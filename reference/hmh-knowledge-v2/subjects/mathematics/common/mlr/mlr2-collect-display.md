# MLR2: Collect and Display
**Mathematical Language Routine #2**
**Source:** Mathematical Language Routines (MLR) Guidelines
**Primary Use:** Tasks (during/after partner or group work)

---

## Overview

**MLR2: Collect and Display** captures students' oral words and phrases into a **stable, collective reference** that supports mathematical communication throughout the lesson and unit.

**Core Principle:** Elevate student language by making it public, visible, and reusable.

---

## Purpose

To create a **living vocabulary wall** or **anchor chart** that:
1. **Captures** student language in the moment
2. **Displays** it visibly for all to see
3. **References** it during whole-class discussion
4. **Supports** precise mathematical communication
5. **Grows** over time as vocabulary develops

**Why It Works:**
- Student language (not just teacher's) becomes the resource
- Visible display supports memory and access
- Collective reference builds shared understanding
- Emergent bilinguals can refer back to displayed language
- Records thinking over time

---

## When to Use MLR2

### Best Situations:
- ✅ During partner or small group work
- ✅ When students discuss thinking using mathematical vocabulary
- ✅ When terms, phrases, or representations worth preserving emerge
- ✅ Building vocabulary over time (not just one-time use)

### Not Ideal For:
- ❌ Independent silent work (no discussion to capture)
- ❌ When vocabulary is already well-established
- ❌ One-time terms not worth displaying long-term

---

## Where to Embed in Into Math TX

### Tasks (After Solving Problem):

**Placement:** "**THEN,** have students use the **Collect and Display** routine to discuss their thinking."

**Position in Lesson Flow:**
1. Students work on task in pairs/groups
2. Teacher circulates and listens
3. **MLR2 HERE** - Teacher writes key language on display
4. Whole-class discussion references the display

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: CIRCULATE (During Partner/Group Work)
**Time:** Ongoing during partner work (5-10 minutes)

**Teacher Actions:**
- Move around room listening to student discussions
- Listen for:
  - Key mathematical vocabulary
  - Precise descriptions
  - Effective phrases
  - Useful representations (gestures, sketches)
  - Sentence structures worth modeling

**What to Listen For:**
- ✅ Students using new vocabulary correctly
- ✅ Clear explanations of concepts
- ✅ Effective comparisons or analogies
- ✅ Questions that push thinking
- ✅ Phrases that capture key ideas

**What NOT to Capture:**
- ❌ Off-task talk
- ❌ Incorrect mathematical statements (unless addressing misconception)
- ❌ Vague or imprecise language (unless refining it)

---

### Step 2: CAPTURE (Write on Display)
**Time:** Ongoing during circulation

**What to Write:**
- **Words:** Key vocabulary (numerator, decompose, equivalent)
- **Phrases:** Effective sentence structures ("I notice that...", "This shows...")
- **Sketches:** Useful diagrams or representations
- **Symbols:** Mathematical notation students use
- **Questions:** Powerful questions students ask

**Display Format Options:**

**Option A: Vocabulary Wall**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Mathematical Language          │
│                                 │
│  • decompose (break apart)      │
│  • compose (put together)       │
│  • "I decomposed the 10 into    │
│    8 and 2"                     │
│  • [sketch of number bond]      │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Option B: Anchor Chart**
```
Ways to Describe Division:
• "How many groups?"
• "How many in each group?"
• "sharing equally"
• "dividing into equal parts"
• [student sketch of 12 ÷ 3]
```

**Option C: T-Chart**
```
What We Heard | What It Means
─────────────┼──────────────
"left over"   │ remainder
"split up"    │ divide/decompose
"build"       │ compose/combine
```

---

### Step 3: REFERENCE (During Whole-Class Discussion)
**Time:** 5-10 minutes during whole-class share

**Teacher Actions:**
- Point to display when students struggle with vocabulary
- Reference specific phrases: "I heard Maya say..."
- Invite students to add to display
- Connect displayed language to mathematical concepts
- Celebrate student language: "This is YOUR mathematical language"

**Example Dialogue:**
```
Teacher: "Who can explain what we mean by 'decompose'?"
Student: "Um... breaking apart?"
Teacher: [Points to display] "Yes! Look at what we captured. Jamaal said
         'decompose the 10 into 8 and 2.' Can you use that phrase?"
Student: "I decomposed the 10 into 8 and 2 to make it easier to subtract."
```

---

### Step 4: MAINTAIN (Throughout Unit)
**Time:** Ongoing

**Keep Display Visible:**
- Post on wall, not whiteboard you'll erase
- Add to it over multiple lessons
- Reference it in subsequent lessons
- Students can add to it independently

**Update Over Time:**
- Add new terms as they emerge
- Refine definitions as understanding deepens
- Connect related terms visually
- Highlight frequently used phrases

---

## Standard Implementation Text

### Full Boilerplate:

## Examples by Grade Band

### K-2 Example (Number Bonds - Decomposing 10):

**Context:** Students decompose 10 in different ways.

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Collect and Display routine to discuss their
thinking.

During pair/group work, circulate and listen to student discussion. Write
common or important words, phrases, sketches, or diagrams such as
"decompose," "break apart," and number bonds on a visual display for
students to see. Refer back to the display during whole-class discussion
to help students communicate ideas more precisely.
```

**What Teacher Captures:**
- Word: "decompose" (heard from Jamal)
- Phrase: "I broke 10 into 7 and 3" (heard from Maria)
- Sketch: Number bond showing 10 split into parts (drawn by Chen)
- Symbol: 10 = 7 + 3 (notation used by Aisha)

**Display Outcome:**
```
Decomposing 10
• decompose = break apart
• "I broke 10 into ___ and ___"
• [number bond sketch]
• 10 = 7 + 3
• 10 = 8 + 2
• 10 = 6 + 4
```

### 3-5 Example (Area Models for Multiplication):

**Context:** Students use area models to multiply 2-digit numbers.

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Collect and Display routine to discuss their
thinking.

During pair/group work, circulate and listen to student discussion. Write
common or important words, phrases, sketches, or diagrams such as "area
model," "partial products," and "decompose" on a visual display for
students to see. Refer back to the display during whole-class discussion
to help students communicate ideas more precisely.
```

**What Teacher Captures:**
- Words: "area model," "partial products," "decompose"
- Phrase: "I broke 23 into 20 and 3"
- Phrase: "The rectangle shows 23 times 15"
- Sketch: Area model with labeled dimensions
- Connection: "Area model is the same as distributive property"

**Display Outcome:**
```
Area Models for Multiplication
• area model = rectangle split into parts
• partial products = the parts you multiply
• decompose = break number into tens and ones
• "I broke 23 into 20 and 3"
• [area model sketch: 20×15 and 3×15]
• Connection: This shows distributive property
```

---

### 6-8 Example (Proportional Relationships):

**Context:** Students identify and describe proportional relationships.

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Collect and Display routine to discuss their
thinking.

During pair/group work, circulate and listen to student discussion. Write
common or important words, phrases, sketches, or diagrams such as
"proportional relationship," "constant of proportionality," and
"unit rate" on a visual display for students to see. Refer back to the
display during whole-class discussion to help students communicate ideas
more precisely.
```

**What Teacher Captures:**
- Terms: "proportional," "constant of proportionality," "unit rate"
- Phrase: "The ratio stays the same"
- Phrase: "It's a straight line through the origin"
- Symbol: k = y/x
- Connection: "Unit rate is the same as constant of proportionality when x = 1"

**Display Outcome:**
```
Proportional Relationships
• proportional = same ratio throughout
• constant of proportionality (k) = the multiplier
• unit rate = amount per 1
• "The ratio stays the same"
• "Straight line through origin"
• k = y/x
• Note: Unit rate = k when x = 1
```

## Teacher Facilitation Strategies

### What to Capture - Decision Making:

**Prioritize:**
- ✅ New vocabulary students are learning
- ✅ Phrases that show conceptual understanding
- ✅ Multiple ways to say the same thing (synonyms)
- ✅ Student-generated representations
- ✅ Connections students make

**Deprioritize:**
- ❌ Terms students already know well
- ❌ Everyday language (unless bridging to academic)
- ❌ One student's unique phrase unlikely to help others
- ❌ Incorrect statements (unless using to address misconception)

---

### How to Capture - Practical Tips:

**Attribution (Optional):**
- "decompose" - Jamal
- Gives credit, honors student thinking
- But can make display cluttered

**Refinement in Real-Time:**
Student says: "It's like... you split it up?"
Teacher writes: "decompose = split into parts"
Teacher: "Yes! The mathematical word is 'decompose.' Great explanation!"

**Visual Organization:**
- Group related terms together
- Use colors to categorize (nouns, verbs, phrases)
- Draw boxes or circles around key ideas
- Use arrows to show connections

---

### Common Challenges & Solutions:

**Challenge 1: "I don't hear any good mathematical language to capture."**

**Solution:** Look for emerging language, not just perfect vocabulary.
- Everyday phrases you can connect to academic terms
- Gestures you can name (student shows splitting → "decompose")
- Sketches worth formalizing

**Prompt Students:**
- "Can someone explain that using a mathematical term?"
- "Who remembers the vocabulary word for what Jamal just described?"

---

**Challenge 2: "The display gets too crowded and messy."**

**Solution:** Curate the display over time.
- Start fresh each unit (archive old displays)
- Highlight most-used terms (star or circle)
- Remove terms once well-established
- Create multiple displays (one per concept)

---

**Challenge 3: "Students don't reference the display."**

**Solution:** Model and prompt usage.
- Point to display during whole-class discussion
- "Look at our display. Which phrase could help you explain?"
- Have students add to display
- Reference it in subsequent lessons: "Remember when we captured...?"

---

**Challenge 4: "I don't have time to write during circulation."**

**Solution:** Streamline the process.
- Write during pauses (as you move between groups)
- Abbreviate initially, expand during whole-class
- Use student volunteers to scribe
- Take photo of student work to add later

### Type 3: "Ways to Say It" Chart (Lesson-Level)

**Purpose:** Multiple phrasings for same mathematical idea

**Format:**
- Central concept
- Multiple ways students said it
- Bridges everyday ↔ academic

**Location:** Posted for lesson or few days

**Example:**
```
Ways to Describe Division:

Everyday Language     Academic Language
"splitting up"    →   dividing
"how many groups?" →  quotient
"sharing equally"  →  partitioning
"left over"        →  remainder
```

---

## Assessment Opportunities

### Formative Assessment:

**What to Observe:**
- Which terms emerge naturally in student discussion?
- Which phrases do students reference from display?
- Which vocabulary is still unclear or misused?
- Do students add to display independently?

**Evidence of Success:**
- ✅ Students use displayed language in subsequent discussions
- ✅ Students point to display when explaining
- ✅ Vocabulary use becomes more precise over time
- ✅ Students suggest additions to display

---

### Student Ownership:

**Invite Students to Add:**
- "Did anyone hear a phrase we should add?"
- "Can someone draw a representation for our chart?"
- "Who found a different way to say this?"

**Student-Created Sections:**
- Let pairs create mini-charts for their strategy
- Post student work samples on vocabulary wall
- Students write definitions in their own words

---

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Emergent Bilinguals:

**Bilingual Displays:**
- Include native language alongside English
- Use cognates when available (proportion/proporción)
- Visual representations for every term

**Sentence Frame Display:**
- Show how to USE the vocabulary in sentences
- Multiple frames for same concept

**Example:**
```
proportion (proporción)
• "This is a proportion because..."
• "I can tell it's proportional by..."
• "The constant of proportionality is..."
```

---

### For Students with Learning Differences:

**Visual Support:**
- Icons or symbols with words
- Color-coding by part of speech (nouns blue, verbs green)
- Clear, large font

**Access:**
- Post at student eye level
- Create mini-version for student desks
- Photograph display for digital access

---

### For Advanced Students:

**Complexity:**
- Include formal definitions alongside student-friendly
- Add connections to other concepts
- Include counterexamples

**Extension:**
- Challenge students to add more precise vocabulary
- Create connections between displays
- Write formal mathematical statements

---

## Time Management

### During Circulation:
- **Listen:** 1-2 minutes per group
- **Capture:** 10-30 seconds to write key phrase
- **Total:** Embedded in normal circulation (no extra time)

### During Whole-Class:
- **Reference:** 2-3 minutes pointing to display
- **Add:** 1-2 minutes for student additions
- **Total:** 3-5 minutes integrated into discussion

**Key Point:** MLR2 doesn't ADD much time; it happens DURING existing partner work and discussion.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Pre-writing the display
**Problem:** Teacher writes vocabulary list before lesson
**Solution:** Capture language from STUDENT discussions, not pre-determined list

### ❌ Mistake 2: Erasing after one lesson
**Problem:** Display is temporary, students lose access
**Solution:** Keep posted throughout unit, students reference over time

### ❌ Mistake 3: Only capturing formal vocabulary
**Problem:** Display looks like textbook glossary
**Solution:** Capture student PHRASES and representations, not just vocabulary words

### ❌ Mistake 4: Never referencing the display
**Problem:** Display exists but students don't use it
**Solution:** Point to it during discussion, prompt students to use displayed language

### ❌ Mistake 5: Too messy or disorganized
**Problem:** Chaotic display confuses instead of supports
**Solution:** Organize visually, use colors/boxes, curate over time

---

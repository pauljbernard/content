# New York Multilingual Learner Standards
**Commissioner's Regulations Part 154**
**Source:** New York State Education Department (NYSED)
**Applies To:** K-12 (New York only, all subjects)

---

## Overview

**New York's Part 154** defines requirements for identifying, assessing, and serving Multilingual Learners (MLLs), formerly called English Language Learners (ELLs). All New York instructional materials must provide appropriate scaffolds and supports for MLLs across all proficiency levels.

**Core Principle:** MLLs must have access to grade-level content standards while simultaneously developing English language proficiency. Scaffolds support access without lowering academic expectations.

---

## MLL vs ELD (CA) vs ELPS (TX)

| Aspect | New York (Part 154) | California ELD | Texas ELPS |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Terminology** | Multilingual Learners (MLLs) | English Learners (ELs) | English Learners (ELs) |
| **Organization** | Integrated in content standards | 3 Parts (Collaborative, Interpretive, Productive) | 4 Domains (LSRW) |
| **Proficiency Levels** | 5 levels (Entering → Commanding) | 3 levels (Emerging, Expanding, Bridging) | 4 levels (Beginning → Advanced High) |
| **Programs** | Bilingual Ed or ENL | Integrated + Designated ELD | Integrated only |
| **Assessment** | NYSESLAT | ELPAC | TELPAS |
| **Scope** | K-12 | K-12 | K-12 |

**Similarity:** All three require scaffolding at multiple proficiency levels and integration with content standards.

## Part 154 Requirements

### Program Models

**New York requires districts to provide either:**

**1. Bilingual Education Programs:**
- Instruction in English and home language
- Content taught in both languages
- Home Language Arts (HLA) component
- Goal: Bilingualism and biliteracy

**2. English as a New Language (ENL) Programs:**
- Instruction primarily in English with scaffolds
- Dedicated ENL instructional time
- Content area instruction with supports
- Goal: English proficiency and content mastery

**HMH Materials:** Provide ENL scaffolds for integrated content instruction. Can support bilingual programs but primarily designed for ENL context.

## NYSESLAT Proficiency Levels

### Five Proficiency Levels:

**Entering (Beginning):**
- Minimal English proficiency
- Single words, short phrases
- Heavy reliance on native language and visuals
- Frequent errors that impede meaning

**Emerging (Low Intermediate):**
- Limited English proficiency
- Simple sentences, present tense dominant
- Some academic vocabulary emerging
- Errors may impede meaning

**Transitioning (Intermediate):**
- Developing English proficiency
- Compound sentences emerging
- Growing academic vocabulary
- Errors less frequent

**Expanding (Advanced):**
- Strong English proficiency
- Complex sentences
- Academic vocabulary developing
- Minimal errors, rarely impede meaning

**Commanding (Proficient):**
- Grade-level English proficiency
- Variety of sentence structures
- Academic language mastery
- Meets exit criteria (reclassified as Former MLL)

**Application:** Materials must provide scaffolds across all five levels.

---

## ENL Standards Integration

### Content + Language Integration

**Part 154 requires:**
- Content standards (Math, ELA, Science, Social Studies)
- Language development embedded in content instruction
- Explicit language objectives alongside content objectives

**Example - Grade 5 Math:**

**Content Objective:**
"Students will add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators."

**Language Objective:**
"Students will explain their strategy using the terms 'common denominator' and 'equivalent fractions.'"

**Both objectives addressed simultaneously in the lesson**

- Commanding: Model academic discourse

**MLR2 (Collect and Display):**
- All levels contribute language
- Teacher amplifies academic vocabulary
- Creates public record of math language
- Supports vocabulary development across proficiency levels

**MLR6 (Three Reads):**
- Entering: Three reads with visual support and simplified language
- Emerging: Three reads with sentence frames

## Part 154 Compliance Requirements

### Required Elements in Lessons:

**1. Content Standard (NY State Learning Standard)**
```
NY-5.NF.A.1
Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators
```

**2. Language Objective** (explicit)
```
Students will explain their fraction addition strategy using
"first," "then," and "because."
```

**3. Proficiency-Level Scaffolds**
- Document scaffolds for all five proficiency levels (Entering → Commanding)
- Differentiate language supports, not content rigor

**4. Instructional Routine** (if applicable)
- MLR, literacy routine, or protocol that supports language development

---

## Universal Scaffolding Strategies (Reused)

### All proficiency levels benefit from:

**Visual Supports:**
- Diagrams, models, graphic organizers
- Pictures and real objects
- Anchor charts

**Sentence Frames:**
- More frames for Entering/Emerging
- Fewer frames for Expanding/Commanding
- Academic language models

**Vocabulary Support:**
- Math vocabulary with visuals
- Cognates (when available)
- Word walls with pictures

**Cooperative Learning:**
- Structured partner work
- Mixed-proficiency grouping
- Language roles (questioner, recorder, presenter)

**See Also:** `/universal/frameworks/eb-scaffolding-guide.md`

## Common MLL Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Lowering Content Expectations

**Problem:** Giving Entering students easier math problems

**Fix:** Same grade-level content, differentiated language support
- All students work on NY State Learning Standards
- Scaffolds support access, not reduce rigor
- Visual and language supports, not simpler math

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Only Vocabulary Support

**Problem:** Teaching vocabulary words without language structures

**Fix:** Address multiple language domains
- Listening, Speaking, Reading, Writing
- Sentence structures and grammar
- Discourse patterns (math argumentation)

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Language Objective

**Problem:** Only content objective listed

**Fix:** Include both objectives
- Content: What students will learn (math/science/ELA)
- Language: How students will communicate learning

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Same Scaffolds for All Levels

**Problem:** One-size-fits-all support

**Fix:** Differentiate by proficiency level
- Entering needs more scaffolds (visual, sentence frames, native language)
- Commanding needs minimal scaffolds (challenging extensions)

---

## MLL and UDL Connection

**MLL scaffolds align with UDL principles:**

**UDL Principle 1 (Engagement):**
- Culturally relevant contexts
- Student choice in topics
- Collaborative learning structures

**UDL Principle 2 (Representation):**
- Visual supports (diagrams, models, videos)
- Multiple language supports (frames, glossaries, native language)
- Auditory options (text-to-speech, videos with captions)

**UDL Principle 3 (Action/Expression):**
- Response options (oral, written, visual, kinesthetic)
- Sentence frames as expression scaffolds
- Technology supports (translation tools, speech-to-text)

**See Also:** `/universal/frameworks/udl-principles-guide.md`

## Bilingual Education Support

### HMH Materials in Bilingual Contexts:

**Materials provide:**
- ENL scaffolds for integrated instruction
- Can be used alongside home language instruction
- Spanish cognates in math vocabulary

**Materials do NOT provide:**
- Full bilingual versions (content in home language)
- Home Language Arts (HLA) curriculum
- Spanish-language assessments

**Clarification:** HMH materials support ENL programs and can supplement bilingual programs, but are not complete bilingual curricula.

**Remember:** New York's Part 154 MLL requirements are similar to other states' EL frameworks but use different terminology (MLLs, ENL) and have five proficiency levels instead of three or four. The core principles remain the same: provide grade-level content access while developing English proficiency through scaffolded instruction. Mathematical Language Routines and Universal Design for Learning provide the foundation for effective MLL support across all proficiency levels.

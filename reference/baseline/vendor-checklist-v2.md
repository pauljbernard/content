# Into Math TX Vendor Guidelines Checklist

**1. Learning Goals**

**Purpose:** To help students self-assess confidence and to clarify
lesson objectives.

**Checklist:**

-   SE: I Can statement (student-friendly, bold math vocabulary).

-   SE: Rating scale (I don't understand / I need more practice / I've
    got it).

-   TE: START boilerplate for routine.

-   TE: Clarifies 1--2 vocabulary terms.

-   TE: Includes 3--5 steps (read aloud, clarify terms, students
    self-assess, review results, revisit).

**Sample:** SE: *I can compose two-dimensional shapes with given
properties.* TE: *Clarify "compose" by explaining it means to put
together shapes to form a new one.*

**2. Before You Teach**

**Purpose:** To provide teachers with conceptual depth, prerequisite
knowledge, objectives, standards, and supports.

**Checklist:**

-   TE: "What should I understand about math?" (≤420 chars, 3 bullets).

-   TE: Prior Learning (3 bullets, past tense verbs, lowercase starts).

-   TE: Focus Standard verbatim (TEKS breakout).

-   TE: ELPS code + text included.

-   TE: Learning Objective + Language Objective.

-   TE: Future Connections (3 bullets, "will..." phrasing).

-   TE: Manipulatives listed (per student, per group, digital).

**Sample:**

-   *Emphasize attributes such as sides and angles when composing
    shapes.*

**3. Spark Your Learning (SYL)**

**Purpose:** To introduce a lesson concept using prior knowledge and
problem-solving routines.

**Checklist:**

-   SE: Problem (≤120 words, solvable with prior knowledge).

-   SE: Bold vocabulary, ends with *Show your thinking*.

-   SE: Spec Type, Spec Description, Alt Text if visual.

-   SE: Turn & Talk with annotation.

-   TE: START boilerplate + MLR6 Three Reads.

-   TE: Spark Discussions --- Common Error (error + TG script + 3 ASK
    Qs).

-   TE: Spark Discussions --- Deepening Thinking (correct example + 3
    ASK Qs).

-   TE: Turn & Talk TG guidance.

-   TE: ML scaffolds (Emerging, Expanding, Bridging).

-   TE: UDL strategy.

-   TE: Vocabulary clarification.

**Sample:** SE: *Maria has 2 triangles and 1 square. How can she make a
house shape?* TE: *ASK: What numbers are important? Possible answer: 2
triangles, 1 square.*

**4. Review Spark Your Learning**

**Purpose:** To revisit the Spark Your Learning problem and guide
reflection.

**Checklist:**

-   SE: Restated problem + reflection Q (*How would you check your
    work?*).

-   SE: Spec Type, Description, Alt Text (if visual).

-   TE: NOW boilerplate.

-   TE: 3 ASK questions (e.g., check subtraction/division).

-   TE: Closing note about informing Differentiation & Practice.

-   TE: Embedded ML support (peer talk, respectful sharing).

**Sample:** TE: *ASK: What operation would you use to check division?
Possible answer: Multiplication.*

**5. Quick Check**

**Purpose:** To formatively assess mastery of the lesson's Learning Goal
and Language Objective.

**Checklist:**

-   SE: Interactions numbered (Interaction 1, 2...).

-   SE: Each interaction includes Manuscript + annotation.

-   SE: Spec Type + Description if visual.

-   TE: NOW boilerplate.

-   TE: Language Objective reference.

-   TE: ML strategy tied to ELPS (frames/starters/word banks).

-   TE: Optional UDL/Common Error support.

**Sample:** SE: *There are 46 swimmers and 7 lanes. How many swimmers
per lane?* TE: *NOW, use the Quick Check... Ask students to orally
explain repeated subtraction.*

**6. Tasks**

**Purpose:** To provide scaffolded practice aligned to TEKS, progressing
in rigor, with SE/TE parity.

**Checklist:**

-   SE: Problem stem (≤150 words).

-   SE: Sub-items A, B, C with annotation.

-   SE: Spec Type, Description, Alt Text (if visual).

-   SE: Turn & Talk included.

-   TE: START boilerplate + Three Reads.

-   TE: TG Qs (≤5 per item).

-   TE: NEXT: Process Standard verbatim + support notes.

-   TE: NOW boilerplate.

-   TE: Supports: Turn & Talk TG, MLR routine, ML/UDL/Common Error.

-   TE: Task 1 only: DOK 1, 2, 3 Qs with annotations.

**Sample:** SE: *Lisa has \$50 to buy goggles that cost \$8 each. How
many can she buy?* TE: *ASK: What numbers are important? Possible
answer: 50 and 8.*

**7. Practice On Your Own (POYO)**

**Purpose:** To give students independent practice and provide TE with
Item Guides and Rubrics.

**Checklist:**

-   SE: Interactions labeled (Interaction 1, 2...).

-   SE: Each includes Manuscript + annotation.

-   SE: Spec Type + Description (if visual).

-   TE: Item Guide (Item #, DOK, Task Alignment).

-   TE: Item Rubric(s) (2/1/0 points + sample answers).

-   At least one rubric aligned to a modeling/visual item.

**Sample:** SE: *Use repeated subtraction to solve 46 ÷ 5. Possible
answer: 9 r 1.* TE: *Item Guide: 3a --- DOK 2 --- Task 2. Rubric: 2 pts
for complete number line model, 1 pt partial, 0 pts incorrect.*

                                      issues with these guidelines, the
                                      Vocabulary Tracker, and the
                                      addition and relabeling of terms.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Vocabulary Guidelines:

**Defining Vocabulary within Lesson -- Student Edition**

-   Reference the **[Vocabulary
    Tracker](https://hmhco.box.com/s/zfgd7e3zztsmnikn5s91u0aul0hexprm)**
    to determine if the vocabulary term should be treated as new or
    review.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [Yellow highlight and **bold** new terms]{.mark}

-   Review vocabulary is neither highlighted nor bold.

-   [Please reach out to HMH LXD via the [**Issue
    Tracker**](https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/R4g4hGJGjv42HQwjPHjfgg5CQCCRp6F62wRmwF91?view=grid)
    and/or email if you encounter issues with these guidelines, need a
    term added to the Vocabulary Tracker, or need a term relabeled as
    "New" or "Review".]{.mark}

-   ~~If as the result of editing or writing new content, a vocabulary
    term now occurs in a lesson that is not documented in the Vocabulary
    Tracker, please add to vocabulary tracker and make the fill for the
    new vocabulary term's cell a bright yellow.~~

    -   ~~If the vocabulary term was already in that grade, insert a row
        in the lesson the vocabulary term is being added to, then copy
        and paste from the other occurrence of the term in the
        vocabulary tracker. Update the lesson information. The Instance
        column will automatically update. Then make sure all other
        instances of the vocabulary term in that grade level are updated
        to 'review'.~~

    -   ~~If the vocabulary term was not used previously in that grade,
        insert a row in the lesson the vocabulary term is being added
        to, then add in the grade #, V2 Lesson \# and definition. The
        Instance column will automatically update.~~

-   For pickup change **\"Connect to Vocabulary\"** to
    **\"Vocabulary\"**

-   **Note**: Grade K does not show vocabulary on the SE page so this
    section does not apply to Grade K

V1 has three approaches vocab was defined.

For V2 SE, define the vocabulary term using the approach that is used
for V1 for this vocabulary term

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| A.  **In a box**      | B.  **In running text | C.  **Within a        |
|                       |     before a task**   |     task.**           |
| ![](medi              |                       |                       |

|                       | height="              | height="1.5in"}       |
|                       | 1.343759842519685in"} |                       |
+=======================+=======================+=======================+
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

If you are adding a new vocabulary term to a lesson or are writing new
content that doesn't have a V1 source lesson, you will have to choose
which vocabulary approach from above (**A**, **B**, or **C**) to use.

-   First choice is **A. In a box**, if there is room on the page for
    it.

-   If adding the box will cause overset, choose between **B.** **In
    running text before a task** and **C. Within a task.** Choose the
    option that makes the most sense for the content and the flow of the
    task.

**Defining Vocabulary within Lesson -- Teacher Edition**

Vocabulary Terms will be mentioned in the Teacher Guide content in the
Teacher Edition. Please see the EMM Guidelines; Task Section; Teacher
Notes Subsection for details.

**Module Opener: Vocabulary**

List **ALL** new vocabulary terms and **TWO** High-Utility words for
every module. In the EMM, the text in the left column is boilerplate and
has already been populated in the EMM template. The vocabulary terms,
high utility terms, and MLRs need to be populated in the EMM template by
the LXDv. See High-utility words guidance below for populating the high
utility terms bullets.

How this section appears in the print TE pages:

> Use Words to Learn (WTL) routine in Classcraft or with the module's
> WTL Vocabulary Cards to help students master any review terms and the
> following new terms:

-   **[\[add vocab term here\]]{.mark}** (Lesson x.y)

-   **[\[add vocab term here\]]{.mark}** (Lesson x.y)

> Consider using the same routines to support students in mastering
> these high-utility words:

-   **\[high utility term here\]** (Lesson x.y)

-   **\[high utility term here\]** (Lesson x.y)

If a module does not have new vocabulary terms:

-   Enter N/A in place of the bulleted list

-   Update the boilerplate in the first row by deleting "and the
    following new terms" so the boilerplate should now read: \"Use
    **Words to Learn (WTL)** in Classcraft or with the module's WTL
    Vocabulary Cards to help children master any review terms.\"

**High-utility words guidance**

Two High-utility words have been selected for each module using the
existing v1 lessons and documented in the [High-Utility Words
Tracker](https://hmhco.box.com/s/z96pcu29e0p7kgrm1znl70bzdylm99tr).

New high-utility words will need to be selected for modules that contain
new lessons and have blank spaces in the tracker. Use the directions
below to select high-utility words for the new lesson, then document the
chosen high-utility words in the [High-Utility Words
Tracker](https://hmhco.box.com/s/z96pcu29e0p7kgrm1znl70bzdylm99tr).

When selecting high-utility words from new lessons, consider the
following:

-   High-utility words are "Tier 2" words that are likely to come up in
    school settings and instruction lines, and might not be commonly
    used in everyday conversation.

-   These words are non-math specific.

-   Look to the Learning Goals "I can" statements and to SE instruction
    lines for possible word choice.

-   Do not repeat a high-utility word that has already been used within
    the grade level.

-   Use the list below as a reference for high-utility words.
    ***\*\*This is not an extensive list.***

**Module Closer: Module Review - Vocabulary section**

When a module has **new** vocabulary terms listed in the [**Vocabulary
Tracker**](https://hmhco.box.com/s/zfgd7e3zztsmnikn5s91u0aul0hexprm), a
**Vocabulary** section is included on the Module Review page before the
**Concepts and Skills** section.

**G1--A1** (See [Module Closer
Guidelines](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1539985381866?s=npx6ghzg714rc5dsolwvdy3qpk0bc3kd)
section for additional information.)

For Module Reviews that have WOLs in print and require a Word Bank, list
**ALL** new vocabulary terms for every lesson in the section labeled
**\[Vocabulary Box\].** The text, **Use vocabulary words to complete the
sentences.**, that has already been populated in the section above the
Vocabulary Box is boilerplate.

For all Word Banks in print, be sure there is parity with the digital
pattern.

Due to spacing, all new terms will not be represented as an item in the
Vocabulary section. Only **2--5** vocabulary items can be authored.
Those 2--5 terms should reflect the most critical content for the
module.

If the module has only one new term, then choose at least one review
term as a distractor for the Word Bank.

If there are no new vocab terms for the module, then type \"N/A\" in the
Vocabulary Box as well as in the Item \# and Learnosity Item Type
columns under the Vocabulary section.

If the Vocabulary item type is line matching in print, the digital
pattern is "Match List" in digital, and a Word Bank is not included for
either component. In this case, enter N/A in the Vocabulary Box section
of the EMM.

**GK** (See [Kindergarten
Considerations](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1539985381866?s=npx6ghzg714rc5dsolwvdy3qpk0bc3kd)
section for additional information.)

The Vocabulary section may include one problem, although multiple new
vocabulary terms may be represented within that same problem.

The vocabulary word should be represented as an image. Students are
using their understanding of the word to answer a question.

Problems in the Vocabulary section should be included in the TE
Data-Driven Instruction table for GK.

If there are no new vocab terms for the module, then type \"N/A\" in the
Item \# and Learnosity Item Type columns under the Vocabulary section.

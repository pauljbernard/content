# CCSS-M Alignment Guide
**Common Core State Standards for Mathematics - California**
**Source:** California Department of Education
**Applies To:** K-8 Mathematics (California only)

---

## Overview

**California uses CCSS-M (Common Core State Standards for Mathematics)** as its content standards for K-8 mathematics. All instructional materials must explicitly align to CCSS-M standards.

**Core Principle:** Every lesson and activity must align to specific CCSS-M standards with clear evidence of alignment.

## CCSS-M vs. TEKS

| Aspect | CCSS-M (California) | TEKS (Texas) |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Standard Format** | CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.{Grade}.{Domain}.{Cluster}.{Standard} | {Grade}.{Process/Content}.{Standard} |
| **Example** | CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.A.1 | 5.3A |
| **Organization** | Domain → Cluster → Standard | Process/Content area → Standard |
| **Math Practices** | 8 Standards for Mathematical Practice | Embedded in content standards |

## CCSS-M Standard Format

### Structure:

**Format:** `CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.{Grade}.{Domain}.{Cluster}.{Standard Number}`

**Example:** `CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.A.1`

**Breakdown:**
- `CCSS` = Common Core State Standards
- `MATH.CONTENT` = Mathematics Content Standards
- `5` = Grade 5
- `NF` = Number and Operations—Fractions (domain)
- `A` = Use equivalent fractions (cluster)
- `1` = Standard #1 within cluster

---

## CCSS-M Domains by Grade

### Elementary (K-5):

**Counting & Cardinality (CC)** - K only
**Operations & Algebraic Thinking (OA)** - K-5
**Number & Operations in Base Ten (NBT)** - K-5
**Number & Operations—Fractions (NF)** - 3-5
**Measurement & Data (MD)** - K-5
**Geometry (G)** - K-5

### Middle School (6-8):

**Ratios & Proportional Relationships (RP)** - 6-7
**The Number System (NS)** - 6-8
**Expressions & Equations (EE)** - 6-8
**Functions (F)** - 8
**Geometry (G)** - 6-8
**Statistics & Probability (SP)** - 6-8

## Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP)

### The 8 Practices:

**SMP.1** - Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them
**SMP.2** - Reason abstractly and quantitatively
**SMP.3** - Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others
**SMP.4** - Model with mathematics
**SMP.5** - Use appropriate tools strategically
**SMP.6** - Attend to precision
**SMP.7** - Look for and make use of structure
**SMP.8** - Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning

**Note:** Unlike TEKS, SMPs are separate from content standards. Lessons should explicitly connect activities to SMPs.

## Alignment Documentation

### Required Elements:

**1. Content Standard(s)**
```
CCSS-M: CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.A.1
Use equivalent fractions as a strategy to add and subtract fractions.
```

**2. Mathematical Practice(s)**
```
SMP.3: Students critique peer strategies for adding fractions.
SMP.7: Students recognize patterns in equivalent fractions.
```

**3. Evidence of Alignment**
Describe how lesson activities address the standard

---

## Example Alignment (Grade 5 Fractions):

**Standard:**
```
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.A.1
Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators (including mixed numbers)
by replacing given fractions with equivalent fractions in such a way as to
produce an equivalent sum or difference of fractions with like denominators.
```

**Lesson Alignment:**
- **Activity 1:** Students explore equivalent fractions using area models
- **Activity 2:** Students add 1/4 + 1/3 by finding common denominator
- **Activity 3:** Students solve word problems requiring fraction addition with unlike denominators

**SMPs Addressed:**
- SMP.2: Students represent fractions abstractly (numerically and with models)
- SMP.6: Students attend to precision when finding equivalent fractions

---

## Differences in Teaching Emphasis

### CCSS-M Emphasizes:

- **Conceptual Understanding First:** Deep understanding before procedures
- **Multiple Representations:** Visual, concrete, abstract
- **Mathematical Practices:** Explicit focus on process standards
- **Fewer Topics, Greater Depth:** Coherence over coverage
- **Progression Across Grades:** Careful vertical alignment

### Example Grade 5 Fraction Progression:

**Grade 3:** Understand fractions as numbers (unit fractions, equivalence)
**Grade 4:** Extend understanding (compare, add/subtract with like denominators, multiply by whole number)
**Grade 5:** Add/subtract with unlike denominators, multiply and divide

**Key Difference from TEKS:** CCSS-M is more explicit about building on prior grades

## Knowledge Reuse

### What's the Same (Reused from Universal/Common):

- **MLRs** - Same 8 routines (subject-common)
- **DOK Levels** - Same 1-4 classification (universal)
- **Assessment** - Same item types, rubrics, validation (universal)
- **UDL** - Same principles (universal)
- **EB Scaffolding** - Same strategies (universal, adapted for ELD)

### What's Different (CA-Specific):

- **Standard codes and format** - CCSS-M vs. TEKS
- **Language standards** - ELD vs. ELPS
- **Vertical progression** - CCSS-M's explicit grade-to-grade

**Remember:** CCSS-M and TEKS teach similar mathematical concepts but with different standard codes, organization, and vertical progression. The pedagogical approaches (MLR, UDL, DOK) remain the same, allowing significant knowledge reuse across states.

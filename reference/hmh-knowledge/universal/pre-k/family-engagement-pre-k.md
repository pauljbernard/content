# Family Engagement in Pre-K
**Age Range:** 3-5 years
**Level:** Pre-K, Transitional Kindergarten
**Applies To:** All Pre-K programs and curriculum

---

## Overview

Family engagement is critical for young children's success. When families and teachers partner, children thrive. In Pre-K, families are children's first and most important teachers.

**Key Principle:** "Families are partners, not participants. We work WITH families, not FOR them."

---

## Why Family Engagement Matters in Pre-K

### Research Shows:

- **Academic Benefits:** Children with engaged families have better literacy, math, and school readiness skills
- **Social-Emotional Benefits:** Stronger self-regulation, social skills, and emotional well-being
- **Long-Term Impact:** Family engagement in Pre-K predicts success through high school
- **Cultural Connection:** Honors children's home languages, cultures, and family strengths

---

## Core Principles of Family Engagement

### 1. Families as Partners (Not Volunteers)

**Partnership means:**
- Two-way communication (families share, teachers listen)
- Shared decision-making
- Recognizing family expertise about their child
- Respecting family values, cultures, goals

**Not just:**
- Asking families to volunteer in classroom
- One-way communication (teacher talks, family listens)
- Telling families what to do at home

---

### 2. Culturally Responsive and Respectful

**Honor diversity:**
- Languages, cultures, family structures, socioeconomic backgrounds
- Parenting practices and values vary by culture
- What "engagement" looks like differs across cultures
- Avoid deficit thinking ("These families don't care")

**Examples:**
- Some cultures value academic preparation, others prioritize social-emotional learning
- Some families show respect by deferring to teachers, not questioning
- Work schedules, transportation, childcare may limit physical presence at school

---

### 3. Strengths-Based

**Focus on what families DO, not what they don't:**
- Every family has strengths, knowledge, and resources
- Recognize "funds of knowledge" families bring
- Build on cultural wealth and home practices

---

### 4. Accessible and Inclusive

**Remove barriers:**
- Offer multiple ways to engage (not just in-person events)
- Provide interpretation/translation
- Schedule events at varied times (evening, weekend options)
- Use plain language (not jargon)
- Ensure physical accessibility

---

## Types of Family Engagement

### 1. Two-Way Communication

**Daily:**
- Brief conversations at drop-off/pick-up
- Photos via class app or newsletter
- Communication log/journal

**Weekly:**
- Class newsletter (what we're learning, upcoming events)
- Photos and learning stories

**As Needed:**
- Phone calls or texts for celebrations or concerns
- Conferences (2-3 times per year)

**Methods:**
- Face-to-face (preferred for important conversations)
- Phone calls
- Class apps (Seesaw, ClassDojo, Brightwheel)
- Email (be aware not all families have regular email access)
- Text messages (brief updates)
- Newsletters (print and digital)

**Tips:**
- Communicate in families' home languages
- Share positives daily (not just problems)
- Be responsive (reply within 24 hours)
- Use multiple methods (some families prefer texts, others face-to-face)

---

### 2. Supporting Learning at Home

**Avoid:**
- Homework for Pre-K (developmentally inappropriate)
- Pressure to teach academics (parents aren't teachers)

**Instead, suggest:**

**Daily Routines as Learning:**
- Cooking together (math: measuring, counting; literacy: reading recipes; science: changes in matter)
- Grocery shopping (math: counting, sorting; literacy: reading labels)
- Bath time (science: sink/float, volume)
- Bedtime routine (literacy: reading aloud daily)

**Play-Based Activities:**
- Play games (board games, outdoor play)
- Read books from library (20 minutes daily)
- Sing songs, tell stories
- Draw, paint, create
- Explore nature (collect leaves, observe bugs)

**Language and Conversation:**
- Talk during daily activities
- Ask open-ended questions ("What do you think will happen?")
- Read aloud in home language (builds literacy skills)
- Teach family languages, songs, traditions

**What Families CAN Do:**
- Provide loving, stable environment
- Read aloud daily in any language
- Talk with child (rich conversations)
- Play and spend time together
- Ensure adequate sleep, nutrition
- Limit screen time
- Encourage curiosity and questions

**Provide Specific, Doable Suggestions:**
❌ "Read more at home" (too vague)
✅ "Try reading one book before bed each night. Your local library has storytimes on Tuesdays at 10am."

## Communication Strategies

### Daily Communication at Drop-Off/Pick-Up

**DO:**
- Greet each family warmly by name
- Share one positive moment about child's day
- Listen to family's information about child
- Keep conversations brief (other families waiting)

**Example:**
"Good morning, Mrs. Rodriguez! Amara, we're excited to see you. [To parent:] Yesterday Amara helped a friend who was sad. She's such a caring friend."

**For Concerns:**
- Don't discuss in front of child or other families
- Say: "I'd love to chat more. Can we schedule a phone call this evening?"

---

### Parent-Teacher Conferences (2-3 times per year)

**Preparation:**
- Review observations, checklists, work samples
- Identify strengths and growth areas
- Prepare specific examples
- Create welcoming space (adult-sized chairs, child's work displayed)

**Structure (20-30 minutes):**
1. Welcome, share strengths (5 min)
2. Discuss development with evidence (10 min)
3. Family input (5 min)
4. Collaborative goal-setting (5 min)
5. Q&A (5 min)

**Tips:**
- Use jargon-free language
- Provide interpreter if needed
- Be strengths-based and respectful
- Listen more than talk (50/50 conversation)
- End with next steps and follow-up plan

---

### Addressing Concerns with Families

**Difficult Conversations:**
- Developmental delays
- Challenging behavior
- Suspected neglect or abuse (follow mandated reporting)

**Approach:**
1. **Start with strengths:** "I want to share some observations. First, let me say what I love about [child]..."
2. **Share specific observations:** "I've noticed... [specific examples]"
3. **Express care:** "I'm sharing because I care about [child's] success"
4. **Collaborate:** "Let's work together on this. What have you noticed at home?"
5. **Problem-solve:** "What do you think would help? Here's what I'm trying at school..."
6. **Follow up:** "Let's check in again in two weeks"

**Cultural Considerations:**
- In some cultures, direct eye contact or directness is disrespectful
- Some families defer to teachers as experts (encourage their input gently)
- Build relationship before discussing challenges
- Use professional interpreter (not child or family member)

---

## Supporting Diverse Families

### Dual Language Learners' Families

**Communicate in home language:**
- Hire bilingual staff when possible

- Invite families to share books, songs in home language
- Learn key phrases in children's home languages
- Display multilingual signs and materials

**Avoid:**
- Telling families to speak only English at home (harmful myth)
- Using children as interpreters
- Assuming families understand English communications

---

### Families Experiencing Poverty

- Never shame or make assumptions

---

### Families with Children with Disabilities

---

### Diverse Family Structures

---

## Family Engagement in Curriculum

---

### Make Learning Visible to Families

**Documentation:**
- Photos of learning moments
- Learning stories shared with families
- Class newsletter explaining what and why we're learning
- Display children's work with learning explanations

**Example:**
Instead of: "We painted today."
Write: "We explored color mixing today. Children discovered that blue + yellow = green! This is early science (observations, predictions) and art (creativity, expression)."

---

**Different Cultural Norms:**

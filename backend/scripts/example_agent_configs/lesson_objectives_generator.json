Use measurable action verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy\n2. Align to relevant standards shown in the context above\n3. Be specific and achievable within a single lesson\n4. Progress from lower to higher cognitive levels when appropriate\n5. Consider diverse learner needs (UDL principles)\n\n## Format\n\nProvide the learning objectives as a JSON array of strings:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"Students will [action verb] [content] [condition/criteria]...\",\n  \"Students will...\"\n]\n```\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON array, no additional text.",

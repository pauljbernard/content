**Grade Bands:** 1 of 2 (50%)
- K-8 covered
- 9-12 (High School) not yet covered

**Knowledge Reuse:** 85-97% across new curricula

---

## Gap Analysis: What's Missing

### 1. State/District Coverage Gaps

**Total US Jurisdictions:** 51 (50 states + DC)

**Standards Alignment Groups:**

**Group A: CCSS-M States (Math) - ~42 states**
- **Already Covered:** California (CCSS-M alignment file exists)
- **Can Reuse:** All CCSS-M states use California's CCSS-M file
- **Additional Work:** State-specific compliance/language files only
- **States:** NY, IL, NJ, PA, OH, MI, WA, OR, CO, etc.
- **Effort per state:** 2-3 files (compliance, language standards, state-specific notes)

**Group B: NGSS States (Science) - ~20 states**
- **Already Covered:** NGSS alignment file exists (universal for all NGSS states)
- **Can Reuse:** All NGSS states use existing NGSS file
- **Additional Work:** State adoption notes only
- **States:** CA, WA, OR, IL, NJ, MD, RI, VT, etc.
- **Effort per state:** 1-2 files (adoption process, state-specific notes)

**Group C: State-Specific Standards - ~10 states**
- **Texas:** Already covered (TEKS)
- **Florida:** Already covered (MAFS/B.E.S.T.)
- **Virginia:** SOL (Standards of Learning) - needs alignment files
- **Indiana:** Indiana Academic Standards - needs alignment files
- **Alaska:** Alaska Performance Standards - needs alignment files
- **Others:** 5-7 more states with unique standards
- **Effort per state:** 4-6 files (standards alignment for each subject + compliance)

**Estimated State Coverage Work:**
- CCSS/NGSS states (30 states): 2-3 files each = **60-90 files**
- State-specific standards (7 states): 5-6 files each = **35-42 files**
- **Total for state coverage: ~95-132 additional files**

---

### 3. Grade Band Gaps

**Current:** K-8 only
**Missing:** High School (9-12)

**High School Specific Considerations:**

**Differences from K-8:**
- Course-based (Algebra 1, Biology, US History) vs. grade-based
- More specialized content
- AP/IB/Dual Enrollment options
- College and career readiness focus
- End-of-course assessments

**Files Needed for High School:**
- High school course sequences (by subject)

---

## Comprehensive File Estimate

### Current (Week 3): 50 files

### To Add for Complete Coverage:

**State/District Expansion:**
- 30 CCSS/NGSS states: 60-90 files
- 7 state-specific standards states: 35-42 files
- **Subtotal: 95-132 files**

**Subject Expansion:**
- Tier 1 (Social Studies, CS): 14-18 files
- Tier 2 (Languages, Arts, PE): 20-26 files
- Tier 3 (CTE, SpEd, GT): 18-28 files
- **Subtotal: 52-72 files**

**Grade Band Expansion:**
- High school (9-12): 15-20 files

**Assessment Systems:**
- State assessments, AP/IB: 10-15 files

**Instructional Models:**
- Alternative models: 10-15 files

**Grand Total Additional Files: 182-254 files**

**Complete National Knowledge Base: 232-304 files**

---

## Efficiency Through Knowledge Reuse

### Why Total is Manageable:

**Universal Layer (15 files):**
- Already created
- Applies to ALL subjects, ALL states, ALL grades
- No duplication needed
- **Reuse rate: 100% across all curricula**

**Subject-Common Layer:**
- Math MLRs (12 files): Used by all 51 states for math
- ELA Literacy Routines (4 files): Used by all 51 states for ELA
- Science Practices (2 files): Used by all NGSS states
- Social Studies practices (8-10 new): Used by all 51 states
- **Each subject-common file reused 50+ times**

**Standards Groups:**
- CCSS-M alignment (1 file): Reused by 42 states
- NGSS alignment (1 file): Reused by 20 states
- **Major leverage through standards commonality**

**DRY Principle at Scale:**

**Without Hierarchical Architecture:**
- 51 states × 10 subjects × ~50 files each = **25,500 files**
- Massive duplication

**With Hierarchical Architecture:**
- ~232-304 files total
- Each file reused many times
- **Reduction: ~98-99% fewer files**

## Prioritization Framework

### How to Decide What to Build Next:

**Market Impact:**
- States with largest student populations (CA, TX, FL, NY, IL)
- Subjects with broadest adoption (Math, ELA, Science, Social Studies)

**Standards Commonality:**
- CCSS states (easy wins - 2 files per state)
- NGSS states (even easier - 1 file per state)

**Customer Demand:**
- What states/subjects does HMH prioritize?
- What are sales asking for?

**Knowledge Reuse:**
- Build subject-common layers first (high ROI)
- Then add state-specific variations

**Recommended Priority Order:**
1. High School (9-12) - extends existing subjects
2. Top 10 states by enrollment (NY, IL, PA, OH, GA, NC, VA, WA, MA, MI)
3. Social Studies (4th core subject)
4. Computer Science (growing demand)
5. Remaining CCSS/NGSS states (easy wins)
6. Additional subjects (Arts, Languages, PE)
7. Specialized (CTE, SpEd, GT)

## Effort Estimates

### Timeline for Complete National Coverage:

**With Current Architecture (Proven ~90% Reuse):**

**Weeks 1-3 (Complete):** 3 states, 3 subjects, K-8 → 50 files

**Phase 2 (4-6 weeks):** +10 states → +25-35 files = 75-85 total

**Phase 3 (3-4 weeks):** +High School → +15-20 files = 90-105 total

**Phase 4 (3-4 weeks):** +Social Studies → +15-20 files = 105-125 total

**Phase 5 (6-8 weeks):** +30 states → +60-75 files = 165-200 total

**Phase 6 (8-10 weeks):** +4 subjects → +40-50 files = 205-250 total

**Phase 7 (6-8 weeks):** +Specialized → +40-60 files = 245-310 total

**Total Time: ~33-43 weeks (8-11 months)**

**With Team of 3-5 Curriculum Experts + Claude Code:**
- Could reduce timeline by 50-60%
- Parallel development across subjects/states
- **Realistic timeline: 4-6 months to complete coverage**

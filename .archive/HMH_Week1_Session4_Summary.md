## Session Metrics

**Time Investment:** ~2.5 hours of focused work
**Output:** 4 comprehensive knowledge files (94KB, ~2,840 lines)
**Average Time per File:** 30-40 minutes
**Quality:** High (comprehensive, validated, cross-referenced)

**Efficiency:**
- Established templates accelerate creation
- Growing examples database (reference previous work)

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well:

1. **Completing Full Sections:** Finishing MLR section (9 files) provides complete, integrated coverage
2. **Critical Path Focus:** Prioritizing ELPS (legal requirement) ensures adoption-critical needs met
3. **Technical Documentation:** Learnosity guide fills implementation gap between conceptual and practical
4. **Cross-Referencing:** Files reference each other extensively, creating knowledge web
5. **Grade-Band Examples:** K-2, 3-5, 6-8 examples in every file provide universal applicability

---

### Areas for Continued Improvement:

1. **File Length:** Some files approaching 25KB - remain mindful of size (still manageable)
2. **Visual Elements:** Text-only format limits diagram possibilities (consider adding flowchart diagrams for Week 2)
3. **Code Examples:** More JSON/code snippets could be helpful (good start in Learnosity guide)

# Scoring Rubrics Guide: The 2/1/0 Point System
**HMH Assessment Standard**
**Source:** HMH Quality Assurance Standards
**Applies To:** All constructed response items (Short Answer, Essay, Drawing, etc.)

---

## Overview

**HMH uses a standardized 2/1/0 point rubric system** for all constructed response items across all programs and grade levels. This ensures consistency, fairness, and reliability in scoring.

**Core Principle:** Rubrics must clearly distinguish between full understanding (2), partial understanding (1), and no understanding (0) using observable, measurable criteria.

---

## The 2/1/0 Point System

### Why 2/1/0 (Not 3/2/1/0 or 4/3/2/1/0)?

**Rationale:**
- **Reliability:** Easier for teachers to score consistently
- **Simplicity:** Clear distinction between full, partial, and no credit
- **Efficiency:** Faster scoring without sacrificing accuracy
- **Alignment:** Matches most state assessment rubrics
- **Fairness:** Reduces subjectivity in middle scores

**Research Base:**
3-point scales (0-2) show highest inter-rater reliability for formative assessment in K-12 mathematics.

---

## The Three Score Points

### 2 Points: Full Understanding
**Criteria:**
- All parts of the question answered correctly
- Work shown is complete and accurate
- Mathematical reasoning is clear and sound
- Vocabulary used appropriately
- No significant errors

**Student Performance:**
- Demonstrates mastery of the concept
- Can apply skill independently
- Explains reasoning clearly

**Example Language:**
"The student provides a complete and correct response with accurate work shown and clear mathematical reasoning."

---

### 1 Point: Partial Understanding
**Criteria:**
- Some parts correct, but missing key elements
- Work shown but contains errors
- Reasoning attempted but incomplete
- Vocabulary attempted but imprecise
- Demonstrates partial grasp of concept

**Student Performance:**
- Understands some aspects
- Needs additional support or practice
- On the path to mastery

**Example Language:**
"The student provides a partially correct response. The student may have made a computational error, omitted a required element, or shown incomplete reasoning."

---

### 0 Points: No Understanding
**Criteria:**
- Incorrect answer with incorrect work
- No work shown (when required)
- Irrelevant response
- Blank/no attempt
- Fundamental misunderstanding of concept

**Student Performance:**
- Does not demonstrate understanding
- Needs reteaching or intervention
- May have misconceptions

**Example Language:**
"The student provides an incorrect or incomplete response with no correct work shown, or the student does not respond."

---

## Rubric Writing Standards

### Required Components

Every 2/1/0 rubric must include:

1. **Clear Performance Criteria** for each score point
2. **Observable Behaviors** (not inferring intent)
3. **Specific to Question** (not generic)
4. **Aligned to DOK Level** (appropriate complexity)
5. **Examples** (when helpful for clarity)

---

### Rubric Template: Standard Format

```
**2 points:** The student [specific action/criterion related to question].
[Additional criterion if needed].

**1 point:** The student [partial criterion]. The student may have
[common error or omission].

**0 points:** The student provides an incorrect or incomplete response,
or the student does not respond.
```

---

### Example Rubric: Grade 3 Addition Word Problem

**Question:**
"Maya has 47 stickers. Her friend gives her 28 more stickers. How many stickers does Maya have now? Show your work and explain your thinking."

**Rubric:**

**2 points:** The student provides the correct answer (75 stickers) with accurate work shown (such as 47 + 28 = 75 or a visual model) and a clear explanation of the solution strategy.

**1 point:** The student provides a partially correct response. The student may have made a computational error but shows understanding of addition, OR provides the correct answer without required work or explanation.

**0 points:** The student provides an incorrect answer with no correct work shown, or the student does not respond.

---

### Example Rubric: Grade 6 Ratio Problem

**Question:**
"A recipe calls for 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of sugar. If you use 8 cups of flour, how many cups of sugar do you need? Explain your reasoning using ratios."

**Rubric:**

**2 points:** The student provides the correct answer (12 cups of sugar) with accurate proportional reasoning shown (such as equivalent ratios 2:3 = 8:12 or scaling factor ×4) and an explanation using ratio language.

**1 point:** The student provides a partially correct response. The student may have set up the proportion correctly but made a computational error, OR found the correct answer without showing proportional reasoning or using ratio language.

**0 points:** The student provides an incorrect answer with no correct proportional reasoning shown, or the student does not respond.

---

### Example Rubric: Grade 8 Linear Equations

**Question:**
"Solve the equation 3(x + 4) = 27. Show each step and justify your solution strategy."

**Rubric:**

**2 points:** The student provides the correct solution (x = 5) with all algebraic steps shown accurately (distributing or dividing, then solving) and explains the inverse operations or properties used.

**1 point:** The student provides a partially correct response. The student may have used correct solution methods but made a computational error, OR provided the correct answer without showing all required steps or justifications.

**0 points:** The student provides an incorrect solution with no correct algebraic steps shown, or the student does not respond.

---

## Rubric Design by Item Type

---

## Alignment with DOK Levels

### DOK 1 Questions (Recall/Reproduce)
**Rubric Focus:** Accuracy
- 2 points: Correct answer
- 1 point: Partially correct (e.g., some parts right)
- 0 points: Incorrect

**Example:** "What is 8 × 7?" (Usually multiple choice, but if constructed response)

---

### DOK 2 Questions (Skills/Concepts)
**Rubric Focus:** Accuracy + Work Shown
- 2 points: Correct answer with accurate work
- 1 point: Correct process with error OR answer without work

**Example:** "Compare two strategies for finding the area of this composite figure. Which is more efficient? Why?"

---

### DOK 4 Questions (Extended Thinking)
**Rubric Focus:** Depth + Connections
- 2 points: Comprehensive response with multiple representations/connections
- 1 point: Surface-level response or single approach
- 0 points: No meaningful connections

**Example:** "Design a real-world problem that requires using the Pythagorean theorem. Solve it and explain why the theorem applies."

**Note:** DOK 4 questions are rare in K-8 and may require extended scoring guides beyond 2/1/0.

---

## Writing Effective Rubrics: Best Practices

### DO: Be Specific to the Question

**Poor Example (Too Generic):**
"2 points: Student demonstrates mastery."

**Good Example (Specific):**
"2 points: The student correctly identifies the unit rate (3 miles per hour) and uses it to calculate the distance traveled in 4.5 hours (13.5 miles) with accurate work shown."

---

### DO: Use Observable Criteria

**Poor Example (Inferring Intent):**
"2 points: Student understands the distributive property."

**Good Example (Observable):**
"2 points: The student correctly applies the distributive property to expand 4(x + 3) as 4x + 12."

---

### DO: Describe Common Partial Credit Scenarios

**Poor Example:**
"1 point: Student makes an error."

**Good Example:**
"1 point: The student correctly sets up the proportion but makes a computational error when cross-multiplying, OR provides the correct answer without showing the proportional relationship."

---

### DO: Align Language with Question Stem

**If question asks "Show your work":**
Rubric should specify "with accurate work shown"

**If question asks "Explain your reasoning":**
Rubric should specify "with clear explanation of reasoning"

**If question asks "Justify your answer":**
Rubric should specify "with mathematical justification"

---

### DON'T: Make 1 Point Too Narrow

**Poor Example:**
"1 point: Student makes exactly one computational error."

**Problem:** What about student who makes correct computation but omits explanation?

**Good Example:**
"1 point: The student provides a partially correct response. The student may have made a computational error, omitted a required explanation, or demonstrated incomplete reasoning."

---

### DON'T: Use Subjective Language

**Poor Example:**
"2 points: Student provides a good explanation."

**Problem:** What is "good"?

**Good Example:**
"2 points: The student provides a complete explanation that describes each step of the solution process using mathematical vocabulary."

---

## Common Rubric Patterns

### Pattern 1: Calculation + Explanation

**Question Type:** "Solve and explain"

**Standard Rubric:**
- **2:** Correct answer + accurate work + clear explanation
- **1:** Correct answer without work/explanation OR partial work with error
- **0:** Incorrect answer with no correct work

**Example:** "Calculate the mean of 12, 15, 18, 20, 25. Show your work and explain what the mean represents."

---

### Pattern 2: Multi-Part Questions

**Question Type:** Multiple sub-questions

**Standard Rubric:**
- **2:** All parts answered correctly
- **1:** At least one part correct (or majority correct if 3+ parts)
- **0:** No parts correct

**Example:** "Part A: Find the perimeter. Part B: Find the area."

---

### Pattern 3: Modeling/Representation

**Question Type:** "Draw a model" or "Create a representation"

**Standard Rubric:**
- **2:** Accurate model + all elements labeled + mathematically correct
- **1:** Model attempted but incomplete, inaccurate, or missing labels
- **0:** Model incorrect or not attempted

**Example:** "Draw a number line to show the addition of -3 + 5."

---

### Pattern 4: Compare/Contrast

**Question Type:** "Compare two strategies/methods/concepts"

**Standard Rubric:**
- **2:** Both items compared + similarities AND differences described + mathematical accuracy
- **1:** Only similarities OR only differences, OR incomplete comparison
- **0:** No valid comparison provided

**Example:** "Compare the strategies used by Student A and Student B for solving 125 ÷ 5."

---

### Pattern 5: Error Analysis

**Question Type:** "Find and correct the error"

**Standard Rubric:**
- **2:** Error correctly identified + corrected + explanation of why it's wrong
- **1:** Error identified but not corrected OR corrected without explanation
- **0:** Error not identified or misidentified

**Example:** "Maya said 3/4 > 5/6 because 4 < 6. Explain her error and provide the correct comparison."

---

## Special Considerations

### Alternative Correct Answers

**Challenge:** Some questions have multiple valid answers.

**Solution:** Rubric must account for all acceptable responses.

**Example Question:** "Name a fraction between 1/2 and 3/4."

**Rubric:**
"2 points: The student provides a correct fraction between 1/2 and 3/4 (such as 5/8, 3/5, 2/3, or equivalent decimals like 0.6) with justification or visual model showing its position."

**Rubric Must Specify:**
- "such as" (not exhaustive list)
- "or equivalent" (accounts for different forms)

---

### Rounding Expectations

**Challenge:** When is a rounded answer acceptable?

**Solution:** State expectation in question stem AND rubric.

**Example Question:** "Calculate to the nearest tenth."

**Rubric:**
"2 points: The student provides the correct answer rounded to the nearest tenth (12.6) with accurate work shown."

**Clarity:** Rubric reflects what question asks for.

---

### Units and Labels

**Challenge:** When are units required?

**Solution:** If question context requires units, rubric must specify.

**Example Question:** "How far did the car travel?"

**Rubric:**
"2 points: The student provides the correct answer (150 miles) with appropriate units and accurate work shown."

**If units missing:** May be 1 point if otherwise correct.

---

### Work Shown Requirement

**Challenge:** How much work is required?

**Solution:** Define "work shown" for each question.

**For Simple Calculation:**
"Work shown" = written equation or labeled drawing

**For Multi-Step Problem:**
"Work shown" = all steps with reasoning

**Example Rubric Phrase:**
"...with work shown (such as a labeled equation, visual model, or step-by-step solution process)."

---

## Examples Across Grade Bands

### K-2 Example: Visual Representation

**Question:**
"Use ○ and △ to show 5 + 3. How many shapes are there altogether?"

**Rubric:**

**2 points:** The student draws 5 of one shape and 3 of another shape (in any arrangement) and correctly states there are 8 shapes altogether.

**1 point:** The student draws the correct quantities but makes an error in counting the total, OR draws an incorrect quantity but shows understanding of combining groups.

**0 points:** The student does not accurately represent 5 + 3, or the student does not respond.

---

### 3-5 Example: Multi-Step Word Problem

**Question:**
"A bakery has 144 cookies. They pack them into boxes of 12. How many boxes do they need? If they sell each box for $8, how much money will they make? Show all work and explain your thinking."

**Rubric:**

**2 points:** The student correctly answers both parts (12 boxes and $96) with accurate work shown for both the division and multiplication, and provides a clear explanation of the solution process.

**1 point:** The student provides a partially correct response. The student may have answered one part correctly but made an error in the other part, OR provided correct answers without sufficient work or explanation.

**0 points:** The student provides incorrect answers with no correct work shown, or the student does not respond.

---

### 6-8 Example: Proportional Reasoning

**Question:**
"A car travels 240 miles in 4 hours at a constant speed. How far will it travel in 7 hours at the same speed? Show your work and explain your proportional reasoning."

**Rubric:**

**2 points:** The student correctly calculates the distance (420 miles) using proportional reasoning (such as unit rate of 60 mph or equivalent ratios 240:4 = x:7), shows accurate work, and explains the proportional relationship.

**1 point:** The student provides a partially correct response. The student may have set up a proportion correctly but made a computational error, OR found the correct answer using trial-and-error or incorrect reasoning, OR provided correct reasoning without the required explanation.

**0 points:** The student provides an incorrect answer with no correct proportional reasoning shown, or the student does not respond.

---

## Integration with Other Systems

### Rubrics + DOK Levels

**DOK 1:** Focus on correctness
**DOK 2:** Focus on correctness + process
**DOK 3:** Focus on reasoning + justification

**Rubric Language Shifts:**
- DOK 1: "correct answer"
- DOK 2: "correct answer with accurate work"
- DOK 3: "complete solution with clear reasoning"
- DOK 4: "comprehensive response with multiple perspectives"

---

### Rubrics + Item Types

**Multiple Choice:** No rubric needed (auto-scored)

**Short Answer:** Brief rubric (1-2 sentences per score point)

**Essay/Extended Response:** Detailed rubric (may list multiple criteria)

**Drawing:** Visual criteria (accuracy, labels, completeness)

**Graphing:** Specific point criteria (points, line, labels, scale)

---

### Rubrics + UDL (Universal Design for Learning)

**Principle:** Rubrics should be student-accessible

**Strategies:**
- Share rubrics with students BEFORE they respond
- Use student-friendly language versions for self-assessment
- Provide exemplars at each score point
- Create visual rubrics for younger students

**Example Student-Friendly Rubric:**

**Original (Teacher Version):**
"2 points: The student provides the correct answer with accurate work shown and clear mathematical reasoning."

**Student-Friendly Version:**
"2 points: I got the right answer, showed my work with no mistakes, and explained my thinking clearly."

---

### Rubrics + EB Scaffolds

**Emerging Level:** Accept visual representations as "explanation"

**Expanding Level:** Use sentence frames for written explanations

**Bridging Level:** Full written explanations expected

**Rubric Consideration:**
May adjust language expectations while maintaining mathematical standards.

**Example:**
"...with a clear explanation (which may include a combination of words, symbols, and visual models)."

---

## Quality Assurance: Rubric Review

### When Reviewing Rubrics, Ask:

1. **Alignment Check:**
   - Does the rubric match what the question asks?
   - Are all stem requirements reflected in the rubric?

2. **Reliability Check:**
   - Would two teachers score the same student response identically?
   - Is the line between 2 and 1 clear?

3. **Validity Check:**
   - Does a score of 2 truly indicate mastery?
   - Does a score of 1 truly indicate partial understanding?

4. **Fairness Check:**
   - Are alternative solution methods credited?
   - Are equivalent representations accepted?
   - Are language barriers minimized?

5. **Clarity Check:**
   - Is language specific and observable?
   - Are examples provided when helpful?
   - Is formatting consistent?

## Common Rubric Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Too Generic

**Problem:**
"2 points: Student demonstrates mastery."

**Why Wrong:** No specific criteria, impossible to score reliably

**Fix:** Specify exactly what mastery looks like for THIS question.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Overlapping Score Points

**Problem:**
"2 points: Correct answer with some work shown"
"1 point: Partially correct with some work shown"

**Why Wrong:** "Some work" is vague; unclear distinction

**Fix:** Use distinct criteria: "complete and accurate work" vs. "incomplete work or contains errors"

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Forgetting the 0-Point

**Problem:**
Only defining 2 and 1 points

**Why Wrong:** Teachers need clarity on when to give 0

**Fix:** Always include: "0 points: Incorrect/incomplete response or no response"

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Too Many Conditions

**Problem:**
"1 point: Student makes one computational error OR omits one label OR shows partial work OR uses incorrect units."

**Why Wrong:** Creates too many 1-point scenarios, reduces reliability

**Fix:** Group into broader categories: "...may have made an error, omitted required elements, or shown incomplete work."

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Misaligned with Question Stem

**Problem:**
Question: "Solve 3x + 4 = 19."
Rubric: "2 points: Student explains why solution is correct."

**Why Wrong:** Question doesn't ask for explanation

**Fix:** Rubric should match stem: "2 points: Student provides correct solution (x = 5) with accurate work shown."

---

## Scoring Guidance for Teachers

### General Principles:

1. **Read the Rubric First:** Before scoring any responses
2. **Apply Consistently:** Same standards for all students
3. **Look for Understanding:** Evidence in student work
4. **Give Benefit of Doubt:** If multiple interpretations exist
5. **Don't Penalize Twice:** One error shouldn't lower score in multiple ways

---

### When in Doubt:

**Ask:**
- "Did the student demonstrate the target understanding?"
- "Is there evidence of mathematical reasoning?"
- "If I explained this to another teacher, would they agree?"

**If Still Uncertain:**
- Consult department lead or scoring guide
- Find similar exemplars
- Document decision for consistency

---

### Edge Cases:

**Correct answer, no work:**
- If question requires work → 1 point
- If question doesn't specify → 2 points (check rubric)

**Incorrect answer, correct process:**
- Usually 1 point (demonstrated partial understanding)
- Depends on rubric specificity

**Alternative method not in rubric:**
- Score based on mathematical validity
- If mathematically sound → score as shown
- Document for future rubric revision

---

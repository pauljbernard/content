## Overview

AP English Language and Composition is a college-level course focusing on rhetoric, argument, and nonfiction analysis. Students analyze how authors use rhetorical strategies and develop their own sophisticated argumentative and analytical writing. The course emphasizes critical reading, rhetorical analysis, and evidence-based argumentation.

**College/Career Readiness:** AP Lang prepares students for college composition, rhetoric, and writing-intensive courses. AP exam scores of 3+ often earn college credit for first-year composition (English 101). The course develops essential skills for law, journalism, business, politics, and any field requiring persuasive communication.

**AP Exam:** May exam with multiple-choice section (rhetoric and reading comprehension) and free-response section (synthesis, rhetorical analysis, argument essays).

## Key Concepts

### 1. Rhetorical Situation (Foundation for ALL Analysis)

**Components:**

**Exigence:**
- The issue, problem, or situation that prompted the text
- What motivated the author to write?
- Example: A scandal prompts op-ed, social injustice prompts speech

**Speaker/Writer:**
- Who is the author?
- What are their credentials, background, perspective?
- What is their relationship to subject and audience?

**Audience:**
- Who is the intended audience?
- What do they know, believe, value?
- How might they react to the message?
- Primary vs. secondary audience

**Purpose:**
- What does the author want the audience to think, feel, believe, or do?
- Inform, persuade, entertain, inspire, call to action, etc.

**Context:**
- When and where was text written/delivered?
- Historical, cultural, social context
- Occasion (specific event or circumstance)

**Genre/Medium:**
- What type of text? (speech, essay, article, letter, etc.)
- How does genre constrain or enable author's choices?

---

**SOAPS Tone (Rhetorical Analysis Tool):**
- **S**peaker: Who is writing/speaking?
- **O**ccasion: What prompted this text?
- **A**udience: Who is the intended audience?
- **P**urpose: What does speaker want audience to do/think/feel?
- **S**ubject: What is the topic?
- **Tone:** What is speaker's attitude toward subject?

---

### 2. Rhetorical Appeals (Aristotelian Triangle)

**Logos (Logic and Reasoning):**
- Facts, statistics, data
- Logical reasoning (deductive, inductive)
- Examples and evidence
- Cause-effect reasoning
- Analogies and comparisons

**Ethos (Credibility and Character):**
- Establish speaker's credibility and authority
- Demonstrate expertise, knowledge
- Show good character, fairness, honesty
- Cite credible sources
- Use appropriate tone and language

**Pathos (Emotion and Values):**
- Appeal to audience's emotions (fear, anger, hope, compassion, pride)
- Appeal to shared values and beliefs
- Vivid language, imagery, anecdotes
- Personal stories
- Loaded language, connotation

**Effective Rhetoric Uses ALL Three:**
- Balance appeals based on rhetorical situation
- Example: Scientific article emphasizes logos, but also uses ethos (credentials) and pathos (health implications)

---

### 3. Rhetorical Strategies and Choices

**Diction (Word Choice):**
- Formal vs. informal
- Abstract vs. concrete
- Denotation (literal meaning) vs. connotation (emotional association)
- Loaded language (words with strong emotional associations)
- Technical vs. colloquial language

**Syntax (Sentence Structure):**
- Sentence length (short for emphasis, long for complexity)
- Sentence types (simple, compound, complex, compound-complex)
- Parallelism (repetition of grammatical structure)
- Repetition (of words, phrases, structures for emphasis)
- Rhetorical questions (asked for effect, not expecting answer)
- Juxtaposition (placing contrasting ideas side by side)
- Anaphora (repetition at beginning of successive clauses)
- Antithesis (contrasting ideas in parallel structure)

**Tone:**
- Author's attitude toward subject
- Formal, informal, serious, humorous, sarcastic, ironic, earnest, nostalgic, critical, reverent, etc.
- Created through diction, syntax, details

**Figurative Language:**
- Metaphor, simile, analogy
- Personification
- Hyperbole (exaggeration)
- Understatement
- Irony (verbal, situational, dramatic)

**Imagery:**
- Vivid sensory details (visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, gustatory)
- Creates mental pictures
- Appeals to pathos

**Examples and Anecdotes:**
- Specific, concrete examples support general claims
- Personal anecdotes create connection, appeal to pathos
- Historical examples establish context, build ethos

---

### 4. Claims, Evidence, and Reasoning

**Claims:**
- Assertion or position author wants audience to accept
- Can be thesis/main claim or sub-claims within argument
- Arguable (not just fact or opinion)

**Evidence:**
- Support for claim (facts, statistics, expert testimony, examples, quotations)
- Relevant and sufficient
- Credible sources

**Reasoning (Line of Reasoning):**
- Logical connections between evidence and claim
- Explain HOW and WHY evidence supports claim
- Commentary and analysis (don't just present evidence)

**Warrants:**
- Underlying assumptions connecting evidence to claim
- Often unstated but crucial to argument
- Example: Claim: "We should raise minimum wage." Evidence: "Many workers earn below poverty level." Warrant: "Workers should earn enough to live above poverty."

---

### 5. Organization and Development

**Methods of Development:**
- **Narration:** Tell story or sequence of events
- **Description:** Use sensory details to create picture
- **Exemplification:** Provide examples
- **Comparison/Contrast:** Show similarities/differences
- **Cause and Effect:** Explain causes or consequences
- **Classification/Division:** Group into categories
- **Definition:** Explain meaning of term or concept
- **Process Analysis:** Explain how something works or is done

**Organization:**
- Chronological (time order)
- Spatial (physical location)
- Order of importance (least to most, or most to least)
- Problem-solution
- Cause-effect
- Compare-contrast (point-by-point or block)

**Cohesion and Transitions:**
- Logical flow between ideas
- Transitional words and phrases
- Repetition of key terms
- Pronouns referring to previous nouns

---

## Reading and Analyzing Nonfiction

### Close Reading of Nonfiction

**Annotation Strategies:**
- Underline key claims and evidence
- Circle rhetorical strategies and devices
- Note rhetorical appeals (L, E, P)
- Identify tone shifts
- Note questions and reactions in margins
- Track line of reasoning

**Rhetorical Précis (Summary Format):**
Four-sentence summary of argument:
1. Name, genre, title (date) + strong verb + THAT clause with main claim/thesis
2. HOW the author develops the argument (strategies, structure)
3. Author's purpose (verb + infinitive phrase) + audience
4. Tone (adjectives)

**Example:**
> In her essay "The Case for Reparations" (2014), Ta-Nehisi Coates argues that America has not reckoned with the economic impact of slavery and segregation. Coates develops his argument through historical analysis of redlining and contract buying, personal narratives of affected families, and economic data demonstrating wealth gaps. His purpose is to persuade American readers—particularly white liberals—to support reparations by revealing the systemic economic theft perpetrated against Black Americans. His tone is measured but urgent, combining scholarly analysis with moral indignation.

### Analyzing Rhetorical Choices

**Key Questions:**
- What is the rhetorical situation? (SOAPSTone)
- What is the author's claim/thesis?
- What rhetorical appeals does the author use? (logos, ethos, pathos)
- What rhetorical strategies and devices does the author use? (diction, syntax, figurative language, etc.)
- HOW and WHY do these choices contribute to the author's purpose?
- How effective is the rhetoric for the intended audience?

**Avoid "Laundry List" Analysis:**
- Don't just identify devices ("The author uses metaphor, repetition, and alliteration...")
- Analyze PURPOSE and EFFECT ("The author's use of extended metaphor comparing democracy to a journey emphasizes the ongoing, collective nature of progress...")

---

## AP English Language Essay Types

### 1. Rhetorical Analysis Essay (Question 2)

**Prompt Format:**
- Provides nonfiction passage (speech, essay, article, etc.)
- Asks you to analyze how author uses rhetorical strategies to achieve purpose

**Task:**
- Identify rhetorical situation (SOAPSTone)
- Analyze rhetorical strategies (appeals, diction, syntax, devices)
- Explain HOW and WHY strategies contribute to purpose
- Evaluate effectiveness (optional, depends on prompt)

**Essay Structure:**
- Introduction: Introduce text, author, context, rhetorical situation, thesis about strategies
- Body paragraphs: Each focuses on specific strategy/strategies, with evidence and analysis
- Conclusion: Overall effectiveness or significance

**Strong Thesis Example:**
> In her speech to the United Nations, Malala Yousafzai uses personal narrative to establish ethos, appeals to shared human values to create pathos, and employs parallelism and repetition to emphasize the universality of education as a human right.

**Key Success Strategies:**
- Analyze, don't summarize
- Explain HOW and WHY strategies work
- Use specific textual evidence (quote short phrases)
- Integrate evidence smoothly with commentary

---

### 2. Argument Essay (Question 3)

**Prompt Format:**
- Presents issue or claim
- Asks you to take a position and defend it

**Task:**
- Develop clear, defensible claim (thesis)
- Support with relevant evidence (from your own knowledge, reading, experience)
- Use logical reasoning
- Acknowledge and address counterclaims (if appropriate)

**Essay Structure:**
- Introduction: Context, claim/thesis
- Body paragraphs: Sub-claims, evidence, reasoning
- Counterclaim paragraph (optional but recommended)
- Conclusion: Reinforce claim, broader implications

**Evidence Sources:**
- Personal experience and observations
- Reading (books, articles, news)
- History, current events
- Common knowledge
- Hypothetical examples (use sparingly)

**Strong Thesis Example:**
- Weak: "Social media has both positive and negative effects." (obvious, not a position)
- Strong: "While social media can connect communities, its algorithmic amplification of extreme content poses a threat to democratic discourse that requires regulatory intervention."

**Key Success Strategies:**
- Take a clear position (don't sit on fence)
- Use specific, relevant evidence
- Explain reasoning (connect evidence to claim)
- Develop sophisticated line of reasoning
- Address complexity (counterclaims, concessions, qualifications)

---

### 3. Synthesis Essay (Question 1)

**Prompt Format:**
- Presents issue or question
- Provides 6-7 sources (texts, visuals, charts)
- Asks you to synthesize at least 3 sources to develop argument

**Task:**
- Develop claim about issue
- Synthesize (combine) at least 3 sources to support argument
- Use sources as evidence, not just list them
- Cite sources correctly (Source A, Source B, etc.)

**Essay Structure:**
- Introduction: Context, claim/thesis
- Body paragraphs: Sub-claims supported by synthesis of sources
- Conclusion: Reinforce claim

**Synthesis vs. Summary:**
- **Summary:** Source A says X. Source B says Y. Source C says Z.
- **Synthesis:** Sources A, B, and C all agree that X, but Source D offers an important qualification: Y.

**Source Integration Example:**
> While advocates argue that school uniforms reduce bullying and improve focus (Source B), studies show mixed results, with some schools reporting no significant change (Source D). However, the economic burden on low-income families (Source E) suggests that mandatory uniforms may inadvertently create new inequities, undermining their intended purpose.

**Key Success Strategies:**
- Read and annotate all sources quickly
- Develop your own claim (don't just report what sources say)
- Use sources to support YOUR argument
- Cite correctly: (Source A), (Source D)
- Integrate at least 3 sources, but can use more

# TEKS Science Alignment Guide
**Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for Science**
**Source:** Texas Education Agency
**Applies To:** K-8 Science (Texas only)

---

## Overview

**Texas uses TEKS (Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills)** for science content standards. All Texas science instructional materials must explicitly align to TEKS Science standards and comply with SBOE Quality Rubric requirements.

**Core Principle:** Every lesson and activity must align to specific TEKS benchmarks with clear evidence of alignment and demonstrate scientific inquiry through hands-on investigations.

## TEKS Science vs. NGSS Key Differences

### TEKS Approach:

**Knowledge & Skills Organization:**
- Standards organized by content strands
- Strand 1 (Scientific Investigation) applies to all activities
- Content strands (2-5) address specific concepts
- Skills and knowledge taught together but not "three-dimensional"

**Example TEKS Standard:**
```
5.5A
Classify matter based on measurable, testable, and observable physical
properties, including mass, magnetism, physical state (solid, liquid, gas),
relative density (sinking and floating), solubility in water, and the ability
to conduct or insulate thermal energy or electric energy.
```

**Structure:**
- Clear, specific content expectation
- Emphasizes classification and properties
- Hands-on, measurable, testable focus

---

### NGSS Approach:

**Three-Dimensional Learning:**
- Performance Expectations integrate SEP + DCI + CCC
- Students DO science (practices) while learning content (DCIs) through crosscutting concepts (CCCs)

**Example NGSS PE:**
```
5-PS1-3
Make observations and measurements to identify materials based on their properties.

SEP: Planning and Carrying Out Investigations
DCI: PS1.A Structure and Properties of Matter
CCC: Scale, Proportion, and Quantity
```

**Structure:**
- Integrated performance expectation
- Emphasizes doing + understanding + thinking

---

## Science Writing in TEKS: CER Framework

### Claim-Evidence-Reasoning Structure:

**Claim:**
- Answer to the scientific question
- Statement of what you learned from investigation

**Evidence:**
- Data from investigation (observations, measurements)
- Specific examples from hands-on work

**Reasoning:**
- Explanation connecting evidence to claim
- Scientific principles that explain why evidence supports claim

**Example:**

**Question:** Is the mystery material magnetic?

**Claim:** The mystery material is magnetic.

**Evidence:** When I brought a magnet near the material, it was attracted to the magnet. The material moved toward the magnet from 2 cm away.

**Reasoning:** Materials that are magnetic are attracted to magnets. Since my material was attracted to the magnet, it must be magnetic. This matches the property of iron and other magnetic materials.

**Integration with TEKS:**
- Aligns with Strand 1 (construct explanations, communicate findings)
- Supports evidence-based reasoning (SBOE requirement)
- Develops science literacy (ELPS support)

## Implementation Guidance

### Lesson Planning with TEKS:

**Step 1:** Identify TEKS Standard(s)

- Safety considerations?

**Step 3:** Plan 5E Sequence
- Engage: Hook and activate prior knowledge
- Explore: Hands-on investigation
- Explain: Vocabulary and concepts
- Elaborate: Apply to new contexts
- Evaluate: Assess understanding

**Step 4:** Integrate ELPS
- Sentence frames for science practices
- Visual vocabulary
- Partner/group work for language practice

**Step 5:** Validate Alignment
- Does activity address all parts of standard?

**Remember:** TEKS Science differs from NGSS in organization (strands vs. 3D) and emphasis (hands-on observable vs. integrated practices), but the pedagogical approaches (inquiry-based learning, CER framework, EB scaffolding, literacy integration) remain universal, allowing 85% knowledge reuse. When designing for TEKS, always start with the specific TEKS standard and ensure hands-on, testable, measurable investigations that comply with SBOE Quality Rubric requirements.

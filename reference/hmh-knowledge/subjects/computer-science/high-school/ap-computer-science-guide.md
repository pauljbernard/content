## Overview

AP Computer Science courses introduce computational thinking, programming, and the impact of computing. AP CS Principles (AP CSP) is a broad introduction to computing concepts. AP CS A focuses on object-oriented programming in Java.

**College/Career Readiness:** Computer Science is essential for STEM careers, especially software engineering, data science, cybersecurity, and technology. AP CS prepares students for college CS majors and computing-intensive fields.

**AP CS Options:**
- **AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP):** Broad intro to computing concepts, programming (any language), internet, data, cybersecurity, societal impact
- **AP Computer Science A (AP CSA):** Object-oriented programming in Java, algorithms, data structures

## AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP)

### Big Ideas

1. **Creative Development** - Collaboration, design, testing, iterative development
2. **Data** - Representation, compression, extraction, transformation, visualization
3. **Algorithms and Programming** - Variables, conditionals, loops, functions, procedures, algorithms
4. **Computer Systems and Networks** - Internet, protocols, security
5. **Impact of Computing** - Beneficial/harmful effects, privacy, bias, equity

### Key Topics

**Programming Concepts:**
- Variables and data types
- Selection (if, if-else)
- Iteration (loops: for, while)
- Functions/procedures
- Lists/arrays
- Algorithms (searching, sorting)

**Data and Information:**
- Binary, hexadecimal
- Data compression (lossy, lossless)
- Metadata
- Extracting information from data

**Internet and Networks:**
- How the internet works (routers, packets, protocols)
- IP addresses, DNS
- HTTP, TCP/IP
- Cybersecurity (encryption, phishing, malware)

**Impact of Computing:**
- Digital divide
- Privacy (data collection, tracking)
- Bias in algorithms
- Intellectual property (copyright, open source)
- Accessibility

### AP CSP Assessment

**Create Performance Task (30% of score):**
- Students develop a program (12+ hours)
- Write about design, algorithm, data
- Submit before exam

**Exam (70% of score):**
- 70 multiple-choice questions
- Conceptual understanding, problem-solving

## AP Computer Science A (AP CSA)

### Course Focus

**Java Programming:**
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Data structures (arrays, ArrayLists, 2D arrays)
- Algorithms (searching, sorting, recursion)

### Key Topics

**Programming Fundamentals:**
- Primitive types (int, double, boolean)
- Using objects (String, Math class)
- Boolean expressions and if statements
- Iteration (for, while, for-each loops)
- Writing classes (constructors, methods, instance variables)

**Object-Oriented Programming:**
- Inheritance (superclass, subclass, extends)
- Polymorphism (method overriding, dynamic binding)
- Interfaces
- Abstract classes

**Data Structures:**
- 1D arrays
- ArrayLists
- 2D arrays

**Algorithms:**
- Searching (linear search, binary search)
- Sorting (selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort)
- Recursion (base case, recursive case)

**Program Design and Analysis:**
- Preconditions and postconditions
- Assertions
- Error handling (try-catch - not tested but good practice)
- Ethical computing

### AP CSA Assessment

**Multiple Choice (50% of score):**
- 40 questions, 90 minutes
- Reading code, tracing code, analyzing algorithms

**Free Response (50% of score):**
- 4 questions, 90 minutes
- Write Java code (methods, classes)
- Question types: Methods and Control Structures, Classes, Arrays/ArrayLists, 2D Arrays

## Programming Languages

**AP CS Principles:**
- Any text-based language (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)
- Block-based languages for beginners (Scratch, App Inventor, Snap!)

**AP CS A:**
- Java (required for exam)
- Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or BlueJ IDEs

---

## Computational Thinking

**Core Practices (both AP CS courses):**
1. **Decomposition** - Breaking problems into smaller parts
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Finding similarities and patterns
3. **Abstraction** - Focusing on important information, ignoring irrelevant details
4. **Algorithm Design** - Creating step-by-step instructions

## Ethics and Societal Impact (Emphasized in AP CSP)

**Key Issues:**
- Privacy and data security
- Algorithmic bias and fairness
- Digital divide and equity
- Intellectual property
- Accessibility for people with disabilities
- Environmental impact of computing

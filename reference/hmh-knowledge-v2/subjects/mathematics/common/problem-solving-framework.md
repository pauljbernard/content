# Mathematical Problem-Solving Framework
**Structured Approach to Problem Solving Across K-8**
**Scope:** Subject-Common (all mathematics programs, all districts)
**Audience:** Curriculum developers creating problem-solving lessons

---

## Overview

**Mathematical problem-solving** is the process of working through details of a problem to reach a solution. A structured framework helps students approach unfamiliar problems systematically and build problem-solving habits.

**Core Principle:** Problem-solving is not a single skill but a collection of strategies, metacognitive habits, and mathematical practices that students develop over time.

---

## Why a Problem-Solving Framework?

### Benefits:

**For Students:**
- Provides structure when stuck
- Reduces anxiety about unfamiliar problems
- Builds metacognitive awareness
- Develops mathematical practices (SMP in CCSS-M, Process Standards in TEKS)

**For Teachers:**
- Common language for problem-solving across grades
- Consistent instructional approach
- Supports gradual release of responsibility
- Integrates with MLRs for language support

**For Curriculum:**
- Coherent K-8 progression
- Consistent structure across units
- Supports transfer of learning

## Four-Step Problem-Solving Process

### Based on Polya's Framework (adapted for K-8):

**1. Understand the Problem**
- Read and comprehend
- Identify what you know and what you need to find
- Restate in your own words

**2. Make a Plan**
- Choose a strategy
- Decide on tools or representations
- Estimate the answer

**3. Carry Out the Plan**
- Execute your strategy
- Show your work
- Check as you go

**4. Look Back**
- Check your answer
- Does it make sense?
- Could you solve it another way?

---

## Step 1: Understand the Problem

### Goal: Make sense of what the problem is asking.

**Student Actions:**
- Read the problem (maybe multiple times)
- Identify key information
- Determine what the question asks
- Restate the problem in own words

**Teacher Prompts:**
- "What is this problem about?"
- "What do you know? What do you need to find out?"
- "Can you retell the problem in your own words?"
- "What information is given?"

**Strategies:**
- **Underline/Highlight:** Key numbers and words
- **Draw a Diagram:** Visualize the situation
- **Act It Out:** Use manipulatives or gestures
- **Identify Known and Unknown:** What do I have? What do I need?

**EB Support (ELPS/ELD):**
- Sentence frames: "I know ___. I need to find ___."
- Visual supports: Diagrams, pictures
- Partner discussion: Turn-and-talk about the problem
- Vocabulary support: Define key terms

**Example (Grade 3):**

**Problem:** "There are 24 students in the class. The teacher wants to make groups of 4. How many groups will there be?"

**Understanding:**
- I know: 24 students, groups of 4
- I need to find: number of groups
- Restate: "How many groups of 4 can you make from 24 students?"

---

## Step 2: Make a Plan

### Goal: Choose a strategy and decide how to solve.

**Student Actions:**
- Select a problem-solving strategy
- Choose tools or representations
- Make an estimate
- Explain the plan

**Teacher Prompts:**
- "What strategy might help you solve this?"
- "What tools could you use?"
- "About how much do you think the answer will be?"
- "How will you start?"

**Problem-Solving Strategies (K-8):**

### Visual/Model Strategies:
- **Draw a Picture or Diagram**
- **Use Manipulatives or Objects**
- **Make a Model**
- **Use a Number Line**

### Organizational Strategies:
- **Make a Table or Chart**
- **Make an Organized List**
- **Find a Pattern**

### Computational Strategies:
- **Guess and Check** (with revision)
- **Work Backward**
- **Write an Equation**

### Logical Strategies:
- **Use Logical Reasoning**
- **Solve a Simpler Problem**
- **Break into Smaller Parts**

**EB Support:**
- Sentence frames: "My plan is to ___." "I will use ___."
- Strategy posters with visuals
- Partner planning (MLR8: Discussion Supports)
- Reference to previous similar problems

**Example (Grade 3 continued):**

**Plan:**
- Strategy: Use manipulatives or draw groups
- Tools: Counters or drawing
- Estimate: About 6 groups (24 ÷ 4)
- Explain: "I will draw 24 circles and make groups of 4 to count how many groups."

---

## Step 3: Carry Out the Plan

### Goal: Execute the strategy and work toward a solution.

**Student Actions:**
- Follow the plan
- Show all work
- Organize thinking
- Check as you go

**Teacher Prompts:**
- "Show your work."
- "What step are you on?"
- "Is your plan working? Do you need to adjust?"
- "How do you know you're on the right track?"

**Expectations:**
- Work is visible (not just in head)
- Steps are organized
- Labels used (units, what numbers represent)
- Self-monitoring happens

**EB Support:**
- Sentence frames: "First, I ___. Then, I ___."
- Work templates/graphic organizers
- Step-by-step checklist
- Peer support: Partner check-ins

**Example (Grade 3 continued):**

**Execution:**
```
[Drawing of 24 circles grouped into sets of 4]
○○○○  ○○○○  ○○○○  ○○○○  ○○○○  ○○○○

Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Group 4, Group 5, Group 6

There are 6 groups.
```

Or numerically:
24 ÷ 4 = 6

---

## Step 4: Look Back

### Goal: Check the answer and reflect on the process.

**Student Actions:**
- Check the answer (does it make sense?)
- Verify with another method
- Reflect on the process
- Consider extensions

**Teacher Prompts:**
- "Does your answer make sense?"
- "How can you check your answer?"
- "Could you solve this a different way?"
- "What did you learn from this problem?"

**Checking Strategies:**
- Compare to estimate
- Use inverse operation
- Plug answer back into problem
- Solve a different way
- Check units and labels

**EB Support:**
- Sentence frames: "My answer makes sense because ___." "I checked by ___."
- Reflection prompts
- Partner sharing: Explain solution to peer

**Example (Grade 3 continued):**

**Looking Back:**
- "Does 6 groups make sense? Yes, 6 groups × 4 students = 24 students ✓"
- "I could also skip count by 4s: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 (6 counts) ✓"
- "My estimate was about 6, and I got exactly 6. ✓"

---

## Strategy Deep Dives

### Strategy: Draw a Diagram/Picture

**When to Use:**
- Visual problem (shapes, measurement, spatial)
- Relationships need to be seen
- Counting or grouping involved

**How to Teach:**
- Model drawing simple, clear diagrams (not artwork)
- Labels are essential
- Encourage schematic drawings, not detailed pictures

**Example:**
"A garden is 12 feet long and 8 feet wide. What is the area?"

[Simple rectangle diagram with 12 ft and 8 ft labeled]

---

### Strategy: Make a Table or Chart

**When to Use:**
- Organized data needed
- Multiple related values
- Pattern recognition

**How to Teach:**
- Show how to set up rows and columns
- Label clearly
- Look for patterns in table

**Example:**
"Pencils cost $0.25 each. How much do 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 pencils cost?"

| Pencils | Cost |
|---------|------|
| 1       | $0.25|
| 2       | $0.50|
| 3       | $0.75|
| 4       | $1.00|
| 5       | $1.25|

Pattern: Add $0.25 each time

---

### Strategy: Work Backward

**When to Use:**
- End result given, need to find starting point
- Multi-step problems
- "How many did I start with?" questions

**How to Teach:**
- Start at the end
- Reverse each operation (add↔subtract, multiply↔divide)
- Check by working forward

**Example:**
"I had some money. I spent $12 on lunch and $8 on a book. Now I have $5 left. How much did I start with?"

Work Backward:
- Ended with: $5
- Add back book: $5 + $8 = $13
- Add back lunch: $13 + $12 = $25
- Started with: $25

---

### Strategy: Find a Pattern

**When to Use:**
- Sequence or repeating elements
- Prediction needed
- Growing or changing quantities

**How to Teach:**
- Identify what changes
- Describe the rule
- Extend the pattern

**Example:**
"The pattern is 2, 5, 8, 11, ... What is the 10th number?"

Pattern: Add 3 each time
Continue: 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29
10th number: 29

Or use rule: Start at 2, add 3 for each step
10th term: 2 + (3 × 9) = 2 + 27 = 29

---

# NYC Multilingual Learner (MLL) Framework
**District:** New York City Department of Education
**Students:** 150,000+ MLLs (14% of enrollment)
**Languages:** 180+ languages spoken
**Assessment:** NYSESLAT (NYS English as a Second Language Achievement Test)

---

## Overview

NYC DOE serves over **150,000 Multilingual Learners** (MLLs), formerly called English Language Learners (ELLs). Students speak **180+ home languages**, with the top languages being Spanish, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), Arabic, Bengali, and Russian.

**Core Principle:** Home languages are assets, not deficits. Materials must support MLLs while honoring and leveraging their linguistic and cultural backgrounds.

---

## Terminology

### NYC DOE Uses "Multilingual Learner" (MLL):

**Preferred Term:** Multilingual Learner (MLL)
**Replaces:** English Language Learner (ELL)
**Rationale:** Asset-based framing; recognizes students' multilingual capabilities

**In Materials:**
- Use "MLL" or "Multilingual Learner" (not ELL)
- Refer to "home language" (not "native language" or "first language")
- Emphasize bilingualism/multilingualism as strength

---

## NYC MLL Proficiency Levels

### 5-Level System (Based on NYSESLAT):

NYC uses the **New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT)** which has 5 proficiency levels:

**Level 1: Entering**
- Minimal English proficiency
- Relies heavily on home language
- Single words and short phrases
- Visual supports essential

**Level 2: Emerging**
- Limited English proficiency
- Short sentences with errors
- Vocabulary developing
- Needs substantial scaffolding

**Level 3: Transitioning**
- Intermediate English proficiency
- Longer sentences with some errors
- Grade-level content with supports
- Increasing independence

**Level 4: Expanding**
- Advanced English proficiency (approaching grade-level)
- Complex sentences with minor errors
- Academic language developing
- Minimal scaffolding needed

**Level 5: Commanding**
- Proficient in English (near/at grade-level)
- Complex language structures
- Academic language proficient
- Ready for mainstream instruction (may still benefit from supports)

---

## NYSESLAT Assessment

### What It Measures:

**Four Modalities:**
- Listening
- Speaking
- Reading
- Writing

**Proficiency Determination:**
- Annual assessment (spring)
- Composite score determines proficiency level (1-5)
- Students exit MLL status at Commanding (Level 5) with certain score thresholds
- Former MLLs monitored for 2 years post-exit

- Academic conversations with protocols
- Structured discussion formats

**3. Multimodal Expression:**
- Allow multiple ways to demonstrate understanding
- Visual, oral, written, kinesthetic options
- Technology tools for creation and communication
- Choice in assessment format (where appropriate)

**4. Explicit Language Instruction:**
- Pre-teach academic vocabulary
- Model academic language use
- Practice with sentence frames and starters
- Feedback on language development (not just content)

**5. Cultural Responsiveness:**
- Diverse representation in materials
- Culturally relevant contexts and examples
- Respect for diverse backgrounds
- Inclusive classroom environment

## NYC-Specific MLL Programs

### Program Types:

**1. English as a New Language (ENL):**
- Dedicated ENL instruction (stand-alone or integrated)
- Certified ENL teachers
- Focus on English language development across modalities

**2. Bilingual Education:**
- Content instruction in home language and English
- Transitional (grades K-6) or Dual Language (K-12)
- Available in Spanish, Chinese, Haitian Creole, Arabic, Bengali, Russian, etc.

**3. Dual Language Programs:**
- 50/50 or 90/10 models
- MLLs and native English speakers together
- Goal: Bilingualism and biliteracy for all

**Materials Implication:**
Materials should support all program models with appropriate scaffolds and, ideally, home language resources.

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### MLL Supports + MLRs (Math):

**Math Language Routines are designed for MLLs:**
- MLR1: Stronger and Clearer Each Time (language practice)
- MLR2: Collect and Display (capture student language)
- MLR8: Discussion Supports (sentence frames, revoicing)

**Application:** Use MLRs with proficiency-level differentiation

**Example:**
- **Level 1-2:** MLR8 with simple sentence frames ("I agree with ___ because ___")
- **Level 3-4:** MLR1 with academic language refinement
- **Level 5:** MLRs for enrichment and precision

---

### MLL Supports + UDL:

**Universal Design for Learning benefits MLLs:**
- Multiple means of representation (visuals, audio, text)
- Multiple means of action/expression (choice in how to demonstrate learning)
- Multiple means of engagement (culturally relevant contexts)

**Application:** UDL + MLL scaffolds create access for all

---

### MLL Supports + CR-SE:

**Culturally Responsive-Sustaining Education for MLLs:**
- Honor home languages and cultures
- Connect to cultural background knowledge
- Diverse representation in materials
- Asset-based view of multilingualism

**Application:** Every MLL scaffold should be culturally responsive

---

## Quick Reference

**NYC MLL Fast Facts:**
- **Population:** 150,000+ students (14% of enrollment)
- **Languages:** 180+ spoken
- **Top Languages:** Spanish (65%), Chinese (15%), Arabic (4%), Bengali (3%), Russian (2%)
- **Proficiency Levels:** 5 levels (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, Commanding)
- **Assessment:** NYSESLAT (annual, spring)
- **Programs:** ENL, Bilingual, Dual Language

**Material Requirements:**
- Scaffolds for all 5 proficiency levels
- Bilingual glossaries (top 5 languages minimum)

---

**Remember:** NYC's MLL population is extraordinarily diverse (180+ languages). Materials must provide robust scaffolds for all 5 proficiency levels while honoring students' home languages and cultural backgrounds. The shift from "ELL" to "MLL" reflects an asset-based approach—these students are multilingual, which is a strength, not a deficit.

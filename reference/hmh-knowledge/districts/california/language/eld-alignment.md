# ELD Alignment Guide
**English Language Development Standards for California**
**Source:** California Department of Education
**Applies To:** K-12 (California only, all subjects)

---

## Overview

**California ELD (English Language Development) Standards** define what English Learners (ELs) should know and be able to do at each proficiency level. All California instructional materials must provide integrated and designated ELD support.

**Core Principle:** ELD standards work in tandem with content standards (CCSS-M, NGSS, etc.) to ensure ELs develop both content knowledge and English language proficiency simultaneously.

---

## ELD vs ELPS (Texas)

| Aspect | California ELD | Texas ELPS |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Organization** | 3 Parts: Collaborative, Interpretive, Productive | 4 Domains: Listening, Speaking, Reading, Writing |
| **Proficiency Levels** | Emerging, Expanding, Bridging | Beginning, Intermediate, Advanced, Advanced High |
| **Standard Format** | Part.Strand.Grade.Level | Domain.Letter (no grade differentiation) |
| **Integration** | Integrated + Designated ELD | Integrated only |
| **Scope** | K-12 | K-12 |

**Similarity:** Both require scaffolding at multiple proficiency levels and integration with content standards.

---

## California ELD Structure

### Two Types of ELD Instruction

**Integrated ELD:**
- Embedded in content instruction (math, science, ELA, etc.)
- All teachers responsible
- Throughout the school day
- Focus: Content + language development together

**Designated ELD:**
- Protected time for explicit language instruction
- ELD specialist or trained teacher
- 30-45 minutes daily (varies by grade)
- Focus: Explicit language skills and strategies

**HMH Materials:** Provide integrated ELD scaffolds for all content lessons.

---

**Note:** Similar to TEKS Foundations strand, but specific to EL needs.

---

## ELD Proficiency Levels

### Three Levels (K-12):

**Emerging:**
- Early stages of English development
- Limited vocabulary and grammar
- Simple sentences, present tense dominant
- Frequent errors that may impede meaning

**Expanding:**
- Developing complexity in English
- Growing vocabulary, more varied grammar
- Compound and some complex sentences
- Errors less frequent, meaning usually clear

**Bridging:**
- Approaching grade-level English proficiency
- Extensive vocabulary, complex grammar
- Variety of sentence structures
- Minimal errors, rarely impede meaning

**Application:** Materials must provide scaffolds at all three levels.

---

## ELD Standard Format

### Format:
**Part.Strand.Grade.Proficiency**

**Example:** `I.A.5.Em` = Part I (Interacting), Section A (Collaborative), Grade 5, Emerging

### Full Example Standard:

**I.A.5.Em** (Part I, Collaborative, Grade 5, Emerging):
"Contribute to conversations and express ideas by asking and answering yes-no and wh- questions and responding using short phrases."

**I.A.5.Ex** (Same standard, Expanding):
"Contribute to class, group, and partner discussions by following turn-taking rules, asking relevant questions, affirming others, adding relevant information, and paraphrasing key ideas."

**I.A.5.Br** (Same standard, Bridging):
"Contribute to class, group, and partner discussions by following turn-taking rules, asking relevant questions, affirming others, and providing useful feedback."

**Notice:** Same skill (collaborative discussion), differentiated by proficiency level.

---

## Integrated ELD in Math

### ELD Standards for Mathematics Content

**Part I.A (Collaborative) - Math Application:**
- Emerging: Share math ideas using sentence frames
- Expanding: Explain strategies with complete sentences
- Bridging: Justify reasoning and critique others' strategies

**Part I.B (Interpretive) - Math Application:**
- Emerging: Understand math problems with visual supports
- Expanding: Interpret word problems independently
- Bridging: Analyze complex math texts and arguments

**Part I.C (Productive) - Math Application:**
- Emerging: Show work with labels and short phrases
- Expanding: Write explanations of math thinking
- Bridging: Produce detailed mathematical arguments

---

### Scaffolding Example: Math Problem

**Problem:** "Maria has 3/4 of a pizza. She gives 1/4 to her friend. How much pizza does Maria have left?"

**Emerging Scaffolds (I.A.5.Em, I.B.5.Em):**
- Visual: Fraction circles showing 3/4 and 1/4
- Sentence frame: "Maria has ___ left."
- Vocabulary support: "left" = remaining, what's left over
- Bilingual glossary: "pizza/pizza, friend/amigo(a)"

**Expanding Scaffolds (I.A.5.Ex, I.B.5.Ex):**
- Visual: Fraction model with equation
- Sentence frame: "First, Maria had ___. Then she ___. Now she has ___."
- Strategy prompt: "Use subtraction to find what's left."
- Vocabulary: "remaining, difference, subtract"

**Bridging Scaffolds (I.A.5.Br, I.B.5.Br):**
- Problem without visual (optional visual available)
- Open-ended response: "Explain your strategy."
- Minimal scaffolds, focused on extending language
- Encourage precise mathematical vocabulary

## ELD and Content Standards Alignment Example

### Grade 5 Math Lesson: Adding Fractions with Unlike Denominators

**Content Standard:**
```
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.A.1
Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators (including mixed numbers)
by replacing given fractions with equivalent fractions
```

**ELD Standards Addressed:**
```
I.B.5 (Interpretive): Listen to and read grade-level math texts
I.C.5 (Productive): Write math explanations
II.B.5 (Expanding Ideas): Use noun phrases (equivalent fractions, common denominator)
```

**Scaffolds by Proficiency Level:**

**Emerging:**
- Visual models of equivalent fractions
- Sentence frames: "1/2 is equivalent to ___." "The common denominator is ___."
- Vocabulary support with images: denominator, numerator, equivalent
- Native language cognates: equivalente (Spanish)

**Expanding:**
- Graphic organizer for finding common denominators
- Sentence frames: "First, I ___. Then, I ___. The sum is ___."
- Vocabulary in context: "Equivalent fractions have the same value."
- Partner discussion with structured protocol (MLR8)

**Bridging:**
- Open-ended: "Explain your strategy for adding 1/3 + 1/4."
- Encourage academic language: "I found a common denominator by..."
- Peer teaching: Explain process to partner
- Extension: "Why does finding a common denominator work?"

**MLR Used:** MLR2 (Collect and Display) - Teacher collects language for finding common denominators

## Common ELD Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Same Scaffolds for All Levels

**Problem:** Providing identical support for Emerging and Bridging students

**Fix:** Differentiate scaffolds by proficiency level
- Emerging needs more scaffolds
- Bridging needs fewer but more sophisticated scaffolds

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Only Vocabulary Support

**Problem:** Only teaching vocabulary words, not language structures

**Fix:** Address multiple ELD standards:
- Part I: Collaborative, Interpretive, Productive (language functions)
- Part II: Grammar and syntax (how English works)
- Vocabulary is necessary but not sufficient

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Lowering Content Expectations

**Problem:** Giving Emerging students easier math problems

**Fix:** Same grade-level content, differentiated language support
- All students work on grade-level CCSS-M standards
- Scaffolds support access, not reduce rigor

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: No Language Objective

**Problem:** Only content objective, no explicit language goal

**Fix:** Include both:
- Content Objective: "Students will add fractions with unlike denominators"
- Language Objective: "Students will explain their strategy using 'First...then...'"

---

## ELD and UDL Connection

**ELD scaffolds align with UDL principles:**

**UDL Principle 1 (Engagement):**
- Emerging students choose contexts (sports, cooking, etc.)
- Bridging students choose level of challenge

**UDL Principle 2 (Representation):**
- Visual supports (diagrams, models)
- Multiple language supports (frames, glossaries, native language)
- Auditory options (videos with captions)

**UDL Principle 3 (Action/Expression):**
- Response options (oral, written, visual)
- Sentence frames as expression scaffolds
- Partner discussions before written work

**Remember:** ELD standards are not separate from content standards—they work together. Every math lesson is an opportunity for language development, and every language objective should be grounded in meaningful content. Integrated ELD means content teachers are also language teachers, supporting English Learners to access grade-level content while simultaneously developing English proficiency.

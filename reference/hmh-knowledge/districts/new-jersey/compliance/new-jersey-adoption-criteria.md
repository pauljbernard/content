# New Jersey Adoption Criteria
**State Department of Education Requirements**
**Source:** New Jersey Department of Education (NJDOE)
**Applies To:** All New Jersey instructional materials (all subjects)

---

## Overview

**New Jersey uses local control for curriculum adoption** with state oversight through NJDOE. All materials must align to New Jersey Student Learning Standards (NJSLS) and support English Learners.

---

## Key Facts

| Aspect | New Jersey |
|--------|------------|
| **Content Standards** | NJ Student Learning Standards (NJSLS) - CCSS-based |
| **Language Standards** | English Learners (WIDA consortium) |
| **Adoption Process** | Local district control |
| **Compliance** | NJDOE guidance |
| **Science Standards** | NJSLS for Science (NGSS-based) |
| **Assessment** | NJSLA (NJ Student Learning Assessments) |
| **EL Assessment** | ACCESS for ELLs (WIDA) |

---

## New Jersey Student Learning Standards (NJSLS)

**Mathematics:**
- NJSLS for Mathematics (based on CCSS-M)
- 95%+ identical to CCSS-M

**ELA:**
- NJSLS for English Language Arts (based on CCSS-ELA)
- Emphasis on evidence-based writing

**Science:**
- NJSLS for Science (2016, based on NGSS)
- Three-dimensional learning

---

## English Learner Support

**New Jersey is a WIDA consortium member:**
- Uses WIDA ELD Standards
- ACCESS for ELLs assessment
- 6 proficiency levels (1.0 Entering → 6.0 Reaching)

**See:** `/districts/illinois/language/illinois-el-standards.md` for complete WIDA guidance (applicable to all WIDA states including NJ)

---

## Knowledge Reuse

### ✅ Reused (95%+):
- CCSS-M Alignment (CA file)
- NGSS Alignment (common file)
- WIDA EL Standards (IL file)
- All MLRs, assessment files, universal frameworks

### 🔧 New Jersey-Specific (5%):
- NJSLS branding
- Local adoption context

---

## Implementation Notes

**Content Standards:**
- Tag with NJSLS codes or CCSS codes (nearly identical)
- Example: NJSLS.Math.5.NF.A.1 ≈ CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.A.1

**Language Support:**
- Use WIDA proficiency levels (1-6)
- Reference WIDA Standard 3 (Math) or 4 (Science)

**Assessment:**
- NJSLA alignment for grades 3-11

---

## Knowledge Resolution Example

**Creating NJ Math Lesson 5.3:**

1. CCSS-M standards → `/subjects/mathematics/districts/california/ccss-m-alignment.md` (reused)
2. MLRs → `/subjects/mathematics/common/mlr/` (reused)
3. WIDA Support → `/districts/illinois/language/illinois-el-standards.md` (reused)
4. Universal frameworks → All reused

**Result:** 95%+ knowledge reuse!

## Quick Reference

**NJ-Specific Files:**
- `new-jersey-adoption-criteria.md` - This file
- `new-jersey-el-standards.md` - WIDA reference (short file)

**Reused Files (~22 files):**
- CCSS-M, NGSS, WIDA, MLRs, assessment, universal frameworks

**Total:** 2 new files, 22 reused files (92% reuse)

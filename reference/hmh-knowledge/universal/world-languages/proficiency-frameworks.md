# World Languages Proficiency Frameworks
**Level:** K-12
**Applies To:** All world languages (Spanish, French, Mandarin, German, etc.)

---

## Overview

World language proficiency is measured using two major frameworks:
- **ACTFL** (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages) - US standard
- **CEFR** (Common European Framework of Reference) - International standard

Both frameworks describe what learners can DO with language (proficiency) rather than what they KNOW about language (grammar rules).

## Assessment Aligned to Proficiency

### Integrated Performance Assessment (IPA)

**Three tasks aligned to three modes:**
1. **Interpretive Task:** Read/listen to authentic material, demonstrate comprehension
2. **Interpersonal Task:** Engage in conversation related to interpretive task
3. **Presentational Task:** Create presentation synthesizing learning

**Example (Intermediate Low - Food/Restaurant Theme):**
1. **Interpretive:** Read restaurant review, answer comprehension questions
2. **Interpersonal:** Role-play: make reservation, ask about menu
3. **Presentational:** Write blog post recommending a restaurant

---

### Proficiency-Based Rubrics

**Focus on what students can do:**
- Comprehensibility: Can native speakers understand you?
- Comprehension: Do you understand authentic materials?
- Language Control: Grammar accuracy
- Vocabulary: Range and appropriateness
- Cultural Awareness: Appropriate use in cultural context

**Not:** Grammar tests, vocabulary lists divorced from use

---

## Heritage Language Learners

**Characteristics:**
- Strong listening/speaking (often Intermediate-Advanced)

**Instructional Needs:**
- Literacy development (reading/writing)

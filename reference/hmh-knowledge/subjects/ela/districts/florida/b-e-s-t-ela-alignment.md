# B.E.S.T. ELA Alignment Guide
**Benchmarks for Excellent Student Thinking - English Language Arts**
**Source:** Florida Department of Education
**Applies To:** K-8 ELA (Florida only)

---

## Overview

**Florida uses B.E.S.T. (Benchmarks for Excellent Student Thinking)** for ELA content standards, adopted in 2020 to replace Florida Standards (which were based on CCSS). All Florida ELA instructional materials must explicitly align to B.E.S.T. ELA benchmarks.

**Core Principle:** Every lesson and activity must align to specific B.E.S.T. benchmarks with clear evidence of alignment.

ELA.5.R.2.1
Explain how text structures and/or features contribute to the overall
meaning of texts.
```

**Lesson Alignment:**
- **Mini-Lesson:** Teacher models how cause-effect structure reveals relationships

## B.E.S.T. vs. Florida Standards (Old) vs. CCSS

**Important Context:** Florida adopted CCSS in 2010 as "Florida Standards," then replaced them with B.E.S.T. in 2020.

### Key Changes from CCSS → B.E.S.T.:

**1. Foundational Skills Strengthened:**
- More explicit phonics benchmarks K-5
- Systematic approach similar to TEKS
- Fluency expectations clearer

**2. Civics Literacy Added:**
- New CL strand (unique to Florida)
- Civics integrated into ELA
- Supports Florida civic education requirements

**3. Content Area Literacy Emphasized:**
- More informational text
- Science and social studies integration
- Discipline-specific vocabulary

**4. Grade-Level Expectations Clarified:**
- More specific benchmarks
- Clearer progressions
- Reduced redundancy

## Civics Literacy Strand (CL) - Florida Unique

### What Is It?

B.E.S.T. ELA includes civics literacy as an integrated strand, supporting Florida's civic education requirements.

### Sample Civics Benchmarks:

**Grade 3:**
```
ELA.3.CL.1.1
Identify basic rights and responsibilities of being a citizen.
```

**Grade 5:**
```
ELA.5.CL.1.2
Identify primary and secondary sources and explain how they support or
contradict a central idea.

ELA.5.CL.2.1
Identify various types of media and discuss the purposes of each.
```

**Grade 8:**
```
ELA.8.CL.1.3
Analyze how evidence supports an argument in persuasive or argumentative texts.

ELA.8.CL.2.2
Evaluate sources for bias, credibility, and relevance.
```

### How to Integrate Civics:

**Strategy 1:** Use primary sources (Founding Documents, speeches)
**Strategy 2:** Analyze news articles for bias and credibility
**Strategy 3:** Research civic issues using multiple sources
**Strategy 4:** Write arguments about civic topics with evidence

## B.E.S.T. Grade Band Progressions

### Reading - Text Structure (R.2.1) Progression:

**K:** Recognize that text can be organized in different ways
**1:** Identify text features and explain how they help understanding
**2:** Identify text structures (sequence, description)
**3:** Describe how text features contribute to meaning
**4:** Explain how text structures support understanding
**5:** Explain how text structures and features contribute to overall meaning
**6:** Analyze how authors develop ideas through text structure
**7:** Evaluate effectiveness of text structures in conveying information
**8:** Analyze how structure and features reflect author's purpose

**Key Pattern:** Recognize → Identify → Describe → Explain → Analyze → Evaluate

## Integration with MAFS (Florida Math)

**Note:** Florida also uses B.E.S.T. for mathematics (called MAFS - Mathematics Florida Standards). The B.E.S.T. branding emphasizes:
- Benchmarks (clear expectations)
- Excellent (high standards)
- Student Thinking (cognitive demand)

Both ELA and Math follow similar organizational principles under the B.E.S.T. framework.

---

**Remember:** B.E.S.T. ELA differs from CCSS and TEKS in its explicit civics literacy strand and strengthened foundational skills. The pedagogical approaches (literacy routines, UDL, DOK) remain universal, allowing 85% knowledge reuse. Civics integration is uniquely Florida and must be authentic, not forced.

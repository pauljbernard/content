### 4.6 Unit Economics

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
- **Direct Sales (Large Districts):** $5,000 - $15,000 per district
- **Inside Sales (Medium Districts):** $2,000 - $5,000 per district
- **Self-Service (Small Districts/Schools):** $200 - $500 per account
- **Weighted Average CAC:** $3,000 per district (blended)

**Lifetime Value (LTV):**
- **Average District Size:** 2,500 students
- **Annual Contract Value (ACV):** $150,000 (2,500 students × $60/student)
- **Average Customer Lifetime:** 5 years (90% annual retention)
- **Lifetime Value (LTV):** $750,000

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**
- **$750,000 / $3,000 = 250:1** (exceptional)
- Industry benchmark: 3:1 or higher is considered good
- HMH CMS: 83x the industry benchmark

**Why Such High LTV:CAC?**
1. High retention (90% annually due to switching costs)
2. Multi-year contracts (3-5 years typical)
3. Expansion revenue (start with 1-2 subjects, expand to 5-8)
4. Large contract values (2,500+ students per district average)
5. Relatively low CAC (product-led growth, word of mouth)

**Months to Recover CAC:**
- **CAC Payback Period:** 0.24 months (1 week)
- Calculation: $3,000 CAC / ($150,000 ACV / 12 months) = 0.24 months
- Industry benchmark: 12-18 months
- HMH CMS: 50x faster payback than industry average

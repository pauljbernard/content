# How to Use this Document

The development of this document was created to be a useful reference
tool in writing consistent alternative text for static images. It is
intended to provide specifications for a large variety of images,
symbols, numbers, and other illustrative interactions that could appear
within any mathematics content or items.

When using this document to write alternative texts:

1.  Become familiar with the front matter of this document, which
    includes the purposes of the guidelines, guiding principles,
    information on visual bias, and best practices for items.

2.  Navigate to the page for the specific image type and refer to the
    general considerations section.

3.  Review the example images and alternative text provided for each
    image type. Use the examples as a general guide to writing the
    alternative text. Be sure to also analyze the item's content and
    grade level to determine how these additional factors may impact the
    script.

4.  If numbers, equations, operations, and/or symbols are embedded
    within an image, refer to the Embedded Math Notation section for
    best practices on providing the appropriate alternative text.

5.  Consult the How to Author Alt Text section to view step-by-step
    instructions on how to enter alternative text in CMS/Learnosity or
    Habitat.

# Purpose of Guidelines

At HMH, text alternatives (also known as alt text) must be pedagogically
sound to be considered sufficient for accessibility.

Before now, text alternatives could be a sentence fragment conveying the
minimum objective description necessary to understand that there\'s an
image present - like \"Apple on table\" or \"Two dogs.\"

But today, we write pedagogical text alternatives: content that
re-creates meaning and relevance for learning purposes.

Text alternatives may be as recognizable as video closed-captioning or
as subtle as a well-written manuscript\--carried in the alt-text
attribute\--that blends into the content surrounding it. As a rule,
think of your text alternatives as an accommodation in assuring equity
and accessibility for all learners. Provide the information that they
need to understand what is happening in the image and do your best to
fit the text alternative in the context of the text that comes before
and after it.

The recommendations in this document are not intended to be inflexible,
but rather to guide the development of creating text alternatives.

# Guiding Principles

Consider the following best practices when writing alternative text for
students who have an accommodation.

-   **Brevity:** Keep descriptions brief. Listening to a long
    alternative text description can create an unnecessary burden for
    learners and require greater short-term memory effort.

-   **Clarity:** Create alternative text descriptions that are clear,
    precise, and straightforward. If the image description needs to be
    listened to several times, the script may lack clarity or be too
    complex.

-   **Drill-Down Organization:** Begin with a brief summary description
    followed by more specific data when necessary. Present information
    in a logical order.

-   **Validity:** Determine if it is necessary to describe the entire
    image. If details within the image are not specifically needed to
    answer the question or understand the concept, it may be sufficient
    to provide just a general description of the image.

-   **Language Complexity:** Use simple, grade-level appropriate and
    subject-specific language in all descriptions. Incorporate language
    and vocabulary from the item's text when appropriate.

-   **Consistency:** Provide image descriptions that are consistent
    within and across items types to ensure a similar user experience.
    Make certain that alternative text is comparable in terms of
    sentence structure, language usage, and length.

# Visual Bias

An item has visual bias if:

-   a visual understanding of the assessed concept is needed to complete
    the task.

-   the assessed skill violates the construct being measured.

-   the alternative text would cause a cognitive overload in order to
    keep track of the

given information.

-   an image requires a tactile representation.

-   the image description would cue the correct answer.

-   a complex explanation or above grade level vocabulary is needed to
    accurately

describe the image.

Images with visual bias should be scripted with a general description of
the image and this boilerplate: "For more information, ask for help."

# Best Practices for Items

1.  Do not provide alternative text for content other than what appears
    within an image. The screen reader functionality is designed to
    provide a script for text in stems, prompt questions, and/or
    distractors.

2.  If providing the alternative text cues the answer, only provide a
    general description of the image (e.g., "A net is shown.").

3.  Be mindful about punctuation usage in the description. End each
    statement with a period to ensure a pause is inserted before moving
    on to the next statement. Commas and colons will also be read as
    pauses of slightly different lengths.

4.  Ensure that no two alternative texts are identical in an item since
    this interferes with the ability to access the item's content.

5.  If multiple pieces of art within the stem or distractors of an item
    have identical characteristics, consolidate the descriptions into an
    introductory sentence(s) beginning with the first piece of art for
    which script is being provided.

6.  Do not insert details into the alternative text that pertain to
    color unless it is mathematically necessary.

7.  When writing alternative text for choices in multiple choice items,
    do not script the answer choice letters (e.g., A, B, C, D, etc.,
    should not be scripted).

8.  Do not provide alternative text for any technology enhanced item
    functionality, such as dragging art into an interactive table or
    plotting points on an interactive coordinate plane.

# 2-D Shapes

**Description of Image**: Two dimensional shapes are simple figures that
have length and width, but lack depth. These geometric shapes are
sometimes described as being "flat."

**General Considerations:**

-   Give the name of the shape or describe the shape's attributes.

-   Specify any labels or dimensions if present.

-   If providing a script requires a complex explanation or above
    grade-level vocabulary, the item has visual bias and should not be
    scripted.

-   *[Note: Many shapes will contain visual bias]{.underline}.* Do not
    script if it violates the construct being measured.

**Example Alt Text 1: Example Alt Text 2:**

What is the height, *h*, of the isosceles triangle below to the nearest
inch?

![](media/image2.emf){width="2.620138888888889in"

# 3-D Shapes

**Description of Image**: Three dimensional shapes are figures that have
length, width, and height. These geometric shapes are sometimes referred
to as "solids."

**General Considerations:**

-   Give the name of the shape or describe the shape's attributes.

-   Specify any labels or dimensions if present.

-   If providing a script requires a complex explanation or above
    grade-level vocabulary, the item has visual bias and should not be
    scripted.

-   *[Note: Many shapes will contain visual bias]{.underline}.* Do not
    script if it violates the construct being measured.

**Example Alt Text 1**: **Example Alt Text 2**:

# Algebra Tiles

**Description of Image**: Algebra tiles are two-color square and
rectangular mathematical manipulatives used to represent numbers and
variables while modeling algebra problems. Like two-color counters, one
side of each tile is yellow, indicating a positive value, and the other
side is red, indicating a negative value.

**General Considerations:**

-   Use *large cube, rectangle*, and *small cube* to describe the size
    and shape of the tiles.

-   Do not include the colors of the tiles, but do specify whether each
    tile is positive or negative.

-   Do not script if doing so will violate the construct being measured.

**Example Alt Text:**

The algebra tile diagram shows a product with binomial factors.

![](media/image13.png){width="2.5in" height="2.5in"}

Represent the diagram as a product of binomial factors and as a
polynomial in standard form.

**Example Alt Text:**

> ![Volume](media/image8.svg){width="0.35694444444444445in"
> height="0.35694444444444445in"}*Algebra tiles in a multiplication
> table. The top factor has 1 positive rectangular tile and 4 negative
> small square tiles. The side factor has 1 positive rectangular tile
> and 4 negative small square tiles. The product is arranged in 5 rows.
> Row 1: 1 positive large square tile and 4 negative rectangle tiles.
> Rows 2 through 5 each have: 1 negative rectangle tile and 4 positive
> small square tiles.*

# Arrays

**Description of Image**: An array is a visual representation which
organizes same-sized squares or objects in rows and columns. Arrays are
used to model concepts such as repeated addition, multiplication, and
ideas about even and odd numbers.

**General Considerations:**

-   Provide the title if one is present.

-   Give a general description of the array. List the number of rows
    first followed by the number of columns.

-   Use the word *grid* when describing the dimensions of a rectangular
    array (e.g., "A ten by ten grid is shown.").

-   Explain the number of boxes shaded in a rectangular array if
    necessary for problem solving.

-   Do not give the total number of objects or parts since this violates
    the construct being measured.

**Example Alt Text 1:** **Example Alt Text 2:**

# Bar Graphs

**Description of Image:** Bar graphs are visual displays which use
either vertical or horizontal bars to represent categorical and
numerical data.

**General Considerations:**

-   Provide the title first if present.

-   Give the *x*-axis label followed by the range and scale if
    applicable. Then give the *y*-axis label followed by the range and
    scale if applicable. (For grades K-4, refer to the *x*-axis as the
    *horizontal axis* and refer to the *y­*-axis as the *vertical axis*.)

-   Specify the category and the actual value of each bar. However, do
    not script when the expectation is to find the value of a category.

-   Explain the position of the data bars when data lands between two
    values (e.g., "halfway between 7 and 8*"*).

-   Do not include the colors of the bars unless necessary for problem
    solving.

-   If construct violates the content being measured, script as, "A bar
    graph is shown."

**Example Alt Text:**

Kayla made this graph to show her friends' favorite kinds of movies.

# Base-Ten Blocks

**Description of Image:** Base-ten blocks are 3-D mathematical
manipulatives used to model basic concepts such as number sense, place
value, counting, and the four operations with numbers.

**General Considerations:**

-   Use *one-thousand-cube* to describe a group of 1,000 cubes.

-   Use *one-hundred flat* to describe a group of 100 cubes.

-   Use *ten-cube rod* to describe a group of 10 cubes.

-   Use *unit cube* to describe an individual cube.

-   Do not include the colors of the blocks unless necessary for problem
    solving.

-   Do not script if doing so will violate the construct being measured.

**Example Alt Text:**

What number is shown in this visual model?

# Box-and-Whisker Plot

**Description of Image:** A box-and-whisker plot (also known as a box
plot) is a statistical graph that shows the distribution of a data set
using the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

**General Considerations:**

-   Provide the title and/or *x*-axis label if present.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Consider the question presented in the stem to determine what
    information must be included in the image description.

-   Identify the range of the number line, the whiskers, and the box.

-   Give a general description of how the box is divided when scripting
    for the median. Do not give the exact value of the median.

**Example Alt Text:**

The box plot below shows the number of ice cream flavors sold at
different ice cream shops throughout a city.

> ![](media/image18.png){width="3.5304352580927385in"

> Cream Flavors Sold. The number line goes from four to twenty-two by a
> scale of two. The whiskers range from five to twenty ice cream flavors
> sold, and the box ranges from eight to fifteen ice cream flavors sold.
> A line divides the box at ten flavors.*

# Circle Graphs or Pie Charts

**Description of Image:** Circle graphs or pie charts are visual
displays of data in which a circle is divided into slices that represent
a proportion of the whole. Each slice signifies a category of data and
shows the relative size of the data as a numerical value or percentage.

**General Considerations:**

-   Provide the title if present and a general description of how the
    circle is divided, including the number and relative size of the
    sections (i.e., whether the sections are equal or unequal).

-   Give the category and data value of each section in a clockwise
    direction starting at the noon hour in relation to a clock.

-   Do not include the colors of the sections unless necessary for
    problem solving.

-   Do not script when the expectation is to find the value of a single
    category.

-   If construct violates the content being measured, script as, "A
    circle graph is shown."

**Example Alt Text:**

Students have the choice of 5 different lunches. The circle graph shows
the number of students who chose each lunch.

![](media/image19.png){width="2.791304680664917in"

# Clocks

**Description of Image:** Analog clocks indicate time using numbers,
clock hands, and sometimes tick marks that represent each minute.
Digital clocks display time using numbers and a colon between the hours
and minutes.

**General Considerations:**

-   Use *short* and *long* when referring to the hands of an analog
    clock.

-   Use *between* when the short hands fall between two hour hands on an
    analog clock.

-   Use *colon* when scripting a digital clock.

-   When the construct being assessed is not related to telling time,
    give the spoken time (e.g., six forty-five).

**Example Alt Text 1: Example Alt Text 2:**

Rafael is finishing his homework in the evening. His clock shows this
time.

Which clock shows 15 minutes before 7:00?

# Compass Rose

**Description of Image:** A compass rose is a tool used on maps, charts,
and coordinate planes to indicate the orientation of the cardinal and
intermediate directions.

**General Considerations:**

-   Indicate that a compass rose is shown when present in items.

-   Only describe the direction that the letter *N* is pointing by using
    *up*, *to the right*, *down*, or *to the left*.

-   Do not script the actual names of the cardinal or intermediate
    directions.

**Example Alt Text**:

A rabbit left its cage at (5, 6) and hopped 2 units east and 3 units
south.

# Coordinate Planes -- Points and Figures

**Description of Image:** A coordinate plane is defined by the
perpendicular intersection of a horizontal number line (*x-*axis) with a
vertical number line (*y-*axis) at the point (0, 0) or the origin. The
locations of points in a coordinate plane are given using an ordered
pair of numbers in the form of (*x,* *y*) where *x* represents the
­*x-*coordinate and *y* represents the *y-*coordinate.

**General Considerations:**

-   Indicate that a coordinate plane is shown and specify the number of
    quadrants.

-   Provide the location of each plotted point or the location of each
    vertex of a graphed figure.

-   If giving the exact location of the labeled points or vertices
    violates the content being measured, describe the points in relation
    to the origin instead of the axes.

-   Read plotted points from left to right. Read vertices of graphed
    figures from left to right in a clockwise direction around the
    figure.

-   Do not script the name of a graphed figure if it violates the
    construct being measured.

# Coordinate Planes -- Lines

**Description of Image:** A coordinate plane is defined by the
perpendicular intersection of a horizontal number line (*x-*axis) with a
vertical number line (*y-*axis) at the point (0, 0) or the origin.
Coordinate planes can be used to graph the relationships of lines and
functions.

**General Considerations:**

-   Indicate that a coordinate plane is shown and specify the number of
    quadrants.

-   Only provide the range and scale of the *x*- and *y*-axes when
    necessary.

-   Describe the shape, position, and any special features of each line.

-   Specify the coordinates of the *x*- and *y­-* intercepts from left to
    right on the graph.

-   Do not script certain features of the lines (e.g., *intercepts*,
    *point of intersection*, *slope*, *equation*, etc.) when the
    construct violates the content being measured.

**Example Alt Text:**

What is the solution to the system of equations shown in the graph
below?

# Fraction Models

**Description of Image:** Fraction models are visual representations of
fractions, including improper fractions, mixed numbers, decimals, and
percents. These models are typically squares, rectangles, or circles
divided into same-sized parts which are shaded to represent a specified
fraction. Fraction models can also be used when performing any of the
four operations with fractions or decimals.

**General Considerations:**

-   Provide a description of the shape and how it is divided.

-   Only describe color or shading when it is necessary for problem
    solving.

-   Do not give the total number of parts or use terms that violate the
    construct being measured (e.g., "Three of four parts are shaded.").

-   Do not provide a script when the expectation is to identify the
    number of shaded parts.

**Example Alt Text 1: Example Alt Text 2:**

# Frames

**Description of Image:** A frame is a visual arrangement of boxes that
provide an anchor for thinking about and working with the landmark
numbers 5, 10, and 20. Frames look similar to arrays and are used to
model concepts such as number sense, counting, and basic operations with
numbers.

**General Considerations:**

-   Provide a general description of the frame.

-   Explain how the frame is occupied by giving the structure of the
    dots (i.e., shape and shading) in the top row and then the bottom
    row.

-   Only describe the color of the shading when it is necessary for
    problem solving.

-   Do not script the arrangement and configuration of dots if it
    violates the construct being measured (e.g., when the item is
    assessing the structure of numbers).

**Example Alt Text:**

Micah has some blue counters and some white counters.

five blue counters. The bottom row shows two blue circles and three
white counters.*

# Histograms

**Description of Image:** A histogram is a statistical graph used to
represent the frequency distribution of numerical data. Different from a
bar graph, histograms represent a large data set and groups information
into equal intervals or ranges.

**General Considerations:**

-   Provide the title first followed by the *x*-axis label, range, and
    scale. Then give the *y*-axis label, range, and scale.

-   Give the interval and actual value of each bar. However, do not
    script when the expectation is to find the value of a bar or
    interval.

-   When a bar lands between two values on the graph, explain the
    approximate location of the data using general language, such as
    *just above*, *just below*, or *midway between*.

**Example Alt Text:**

The histogram below shows the number of pushups Coach Price's athletes
completed during a fitness test.

# Line and Angle Relationships

**Description of Image**: Line and angle relationships are often modeled
using diagrams to explore and apply the properties of lines which result
in special angle relationships.

**General Considerations**:

-   Give a general explanation of what the diagram shows by describing
    the lines and/or angles.

-   Specify the names, labels, and measurements of the lines and angles
    if present.

-   Provide all information necessary for problem solving.

-   Do not script certain characteristics of the lines or angles when
    the construct violates the content being measured.

-   If providing a script requires a lengthy or complex explanation, the
    item has visual bias and should not be scripted.

**Example Alt Text 1: Example Alt Text 2:**

# Line Graphs

**Description of Image**: Line graphs are visual displays of data in
which the relationship between two variables is graphed as individual
data points connected by a line on a coordinate plane.

**General Considerations:**

-   Provide the title first followed by the *x*-axis label, range, and
    scale. Then give *y*-axis label, range, and scale.

-   Identify where the graph of the line begins and describe the shape
    and position of the line.

-   If a linear or proportional relationship is shown (i.e., a straight
    line), specify 1-2 points that the line passes through on the graph.
    However, do not script the points if doing so cues the correct
    answer.

-   If a non-linear relationship is shown with less than ten points
    graphed, describe the individual points as long as it does not cause
    a cognitive overload.

-   If construct violates the content being measured, script as, "A line
    graph is shown."

**Example Alt Text:**

The graph shows a proportional relationship between the number of pounds
of watermelon, *x*, and the total cost in dollar, *y*.

![](media/image32.png){width="2.4in" height="2.452777777777778in"}

**Cost of Watermelons**

# Line Plots and Dot Plots

**Description of Image:** Line plots and dot plots are statistical
graphs that show the frequency and distribution of data on a number
line. Each piece of data is represented with either an X or a dot
plotted above the values along a number line.

**General Considerations:**

-   Provide the title and/or *x*-axis label if present.

-   Describe the number line by providing the range of numbers and
    scale.

-   If a number line uses negative values, specify whether the value is
    *negative* or *positive* when providing the range.

-   If the construct being measured contains fractions or decimals,
    describe how the number line is divided.

-   Describe the data for each value on the number line. If providing a
    script cues the answer, the item has visual bias and should not be
    scripted.

-   Do not script for values on the number line without data associated
    (e.g., "Zero dots at five days," should not be scripted).

**Example Alt Text:**

Sara asked a group of students how many days they went swimming last
week. She recorded the results in the dot plot below.

![](media/image33.png){width="2.9131944444444446in"

above four days. One dot above six days. Two dots above seven days.*

# Maps

**Description of Image**: A map is diagram of an area that is used to
represent the location of places or objects in relation to one another.

**General Considerations:**

-   Provide the title if one is given and give a general description of
    what the map shows.

-   Explain any features of the map that are necessary for problem
    solving (e.g., plotted points/locations, labels, measurements, the
    compass rose, scale, etc.).

-   Consider the question presented in the stem to determine what
    information must be included in the image description.

-   If construct violates the content being measured, script as, "A map
    is shown."

**Example Alt Text:**

The map below shows part of a train route that connects three train
stations.

# Measuring Cups and Beakers 

**Description of Image:** Measuring cups and beakers are graduated
containers or jars typically used to measure the volume of liquids or
dry ingredients.

**General Considerations:**

-   Use the language from the stem or prompt question if possible (e.g.,
    *measuring cup*, *beaker*, *jar*, etc.).

-   Provide the range and scale of the measurements on the container.

-   Describe the actual measurement of the contents in the container.

-   If the measurement falls between two values, give the approximate
    location of the measurement and specify that it is an estimate.

-   Do not script if doing so will violate the construct being measured.

# Money

**Description of Image:** Money is sometimes visually represented using
realistic bills and coins.

**General Considerations:**

-   Coins should be scripted as *quarter*, *dime*, *nickel*, *penny*,
    etc.

-   If the coin prominently displays the monetary value, provide the
    value followed by the word *coin* (e.g., *twenty-five cent coin, one
    cent coin*, etc.).

-   Bills should be scripted as *twenty-dollar bill, five-dollar bill,
    one-dollar bill*, etc., unless it violates the construct being
    measured.

-   Do not provide a script if the expectation is to identify the
    coin(s).

-   If construct violates the content being measured, script as, "Coins
    (or bills) are shown."

# Nets 

**Description of Image**: A net is two-dimensional representation of a
three-dimensional shape, which is often used to model the concepts of
surface area and volume.

**General Considerations:**

-   Give the name of the 3-D shape or describe the shapes that make up
    the net.

-   Specify any labels or dimensions if present.

-   Do not script items if the expectation is to compose or identify a
    3-D shape from a 2-D image or vice versa.

-   If providing a script requires a complex explanation or above
    grade-level vocabulary, the item has visual bias and should not be
    scripted.

-   *[Note: Many shapes will contain visual bias]{.underline}.* Do not
    script if it violates the construct being measured.

# Number Lines -- General 

**Description of Image:** Number lines are visual representations of
real numbers on horizontal or vertical lines marked at equal intervals.
Number lines are used to model number sense and relationships, which are
often represented by plotted points.

**General Considerations:**

-   Provide the title and/or *x*-axis label if present.

-   Describe the number line by providing the range of numbers, scale if
    necessary, and the location of any plotted points listed from left
    to right.

-   If a number line uses negative values, specify whether the value is
    *negative* or *positive* when providing the range of the *x*-axis.

-   If a point falls between two values, give a description of the
    approximate location.

-   If giving the exact location of labeled points violates the content
    being measured, provide a general script instead (e.g., "Four points
    labeled A, B, C, and D are plotted on the number line.").

**Example Alt Text:**

Which point represents the opposite of point *Y* on the number line
below?

# Number Lines -- Fractions and Decimals

**Description of Image:** Number lines are visual representations of
real numbers on horizontal or vertical lines marked at equal intervals.
Number lines can use whole numbers, fractions, and/or decimals to model
number sense and relationships.

**General Considerations:**

-   Provide the title and/or *x*-axis label if present.

-   Describe the number line by providing the range of numbers and scale
    if necessary.

-   If a number line uses negative values, specify whether the value is
    *negative* or *positive* when providing the range.

-   If the construct being measured contains fractions or decimals,
    describe how the number line is divided (e.g., "Marks divide the
    space between each number into four equal parts.").

-   If fraction or decimal sense is not the construct being measured,
    describe the parts by using fractions (e.g., "Marks divide the space
    between each number into fourths.").

# Rulers

**Description of Image:** A ruler is sometimes visually presented as a
tool used to measure objects in inches, feet, yards, millimeters, or
centimeters.

**General Considerations:**

-   Describe the ruler and the units being measured.

-   If the ruler contains fractional units, describe how the ruler is
    divided (e.g., "Marks divide the space between each number into
    fourths.").

-   Give the start and endpoint of the image being measured.

-   If the object being measured beings at zero, the item cannot be
    scripted due to visual bias.

-   If two objects are being measured to make a comparison, provide a
    separate script for each object.

-   If the object being measured falls between two numbers on the ruler,
    give the approximate location and specify that it is an estimate.

# Scatter Plots

**Description of Image:** A scatter plot is a statistical graph used to
show the relationship between two variables of a data set plotted as
points on a coordinate plane. Scatter plots usually deal with a large
data set which can be analyzed to determine the correlation between the
two variables.

**General Considerations:**

-   Provide the title first, followed by the *x*-axis label, range, and
    scale. Then give the *y*-axis label, range, and scale.

-   Give a brief description of the arrangement of the points by
    describing the correlation and pattern (e.g., *concentrated*,
    *loosely scattered*, *spread out*, *upward trend*, *downward trend*,
    etc.).

-   If the scatter plot has a line of best fit, describe its position in
    relationship to the points (i.e., how many points are above, on, or
    below the line) or by giving the slope of the line.

-   If less than eight points are shown, describe the individual points
    as long as it does not cause a cognitive overload.

-   If construct violates the content being measured, script as, "A
    scatter plot is shown."

**Example Alt Text 1:**

# Tally Charts

**Description of Image:** A tally chart is a table used to record the
frequency and distribution of data using tally marks instead of numbers.

**General Considerations:**

-   Provide the title and column or row headers if present.

-   If there are no column or row headers, briefly explain what is shown
    in the tally chart.

-   Describe the data for each table entry by identifying the category
    and the total number of tally marks.

-   Do not give the total number of tally marks when the expectation is
    to read the tally chart. Instead, refer to the tally marks as a
    group (e.g., "one group of five," "one group of two," etc.).

a.  Summary Alt Text

b.  Image Alt Text field or fields

The "Summary Alt Text" field in the Set-Up Area allows for a description
of the whole interaction. This should NOT be used for Image alt text.

![](media/image72.png){width="6.0in" height="3.030097331583552in"}

The "Alt Text" field next to the image itself is where you should add
alt text. Each image will have its own Alt Text field, and if an image
is added the field will also be added.

Add your image alt text to the field as plain text, then save and close
the widget.

# Embedded Math Notation 

The following specifications are a general guide for instances where a
number, equation, operation, or symbol is embedded within an image.
These best practices provide an additional guide for authoring
alternative text.

1.  **[Scripts for Numbers]{.underline}**

    1.  **Decimals**

    -   Use *and* between the whole number and decimal.

    -   Use *point* and list each individual digit separately when an
        item is assessing place value.

    -   Use *repeating* when a bar appears over a digit(s).

    -   *[Example:]{.underline}* 4.32 min. should be scripted as, "Four
        and thirty-two hundredths minutes."

    -   *[Example:]{.underline}* $0.\overline{7}$ should be scripted as,
        "Seven tenths repeating."

    2.  **Fractions and Mixed Numbers**

    -   Use a two word description for proper and improper fractions
        with a numerator and/or denominator less than or equal to 20.

    -   Use *a fraction with numerator \_\_\_ and denominator \_\_\_*
        for proper and improper fractions with a numerator and/or
        denominator greater than 20.

    -   Use *and* between the whole number and fraction in a mixed
        number. The same considerations above should be used for
        scripting the fraction portion of the mixed number.

    -   Do not script shortcuts for common fractions (e.g., *a half,
        three-quarters*, etc.).

    -   *[Example:]{.underline}* $\frac{1}{4}$ should be scripted as,
        "One fourth."

    -   *[Example:]{.underline}* $\frac{50}{6}$ should be scripted as,
        "A fraction with numerator fifty and denominator six."

    -   *[Example:]{.underline}* $8\frac{3}{12}$ should be scripted as,
        "Eight and three twelfths."

    3.  **Large Numbers**

    -   Use the proper written name for all large numbers given in
        standard form.

    -   List each individual digit separately when an item is assessing
        place value.

    -   Do not include the word *and* in numbers over one hundred.

    -   *[Example:]{.underline}* 65,029 should be scripted as,
        "Sixty-five thousand, twenty-nine."

    -   *[Example:]{.underline}* 107,384 used in an item that assess
        place value should be scripted as, "One zero seven comma three
        eight four."

    4.  **Negative Numbers**

    -   Use *negative* instead of a hyphen, en-dash, or minus sign.

        set of parentheses that contain a standalone value, variable, or
        equation.

    -   *[Example:]{.underline}* --5 should be scripted as, "Negative
        five."

# Contributions

The authors of this guide would like to acknowledge the many
organizations that were helpful in creating the content procured within
this document. The goal of providing highly accessible content and media
at HMH could not have been authored without the leadership of the
National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM), which has played a crucial
role in addressing the barriers to technology for students with
disabilities. NCAM brings an unparalleled level of expertise to the
advancement of accessibility and has been a forerunner in paving the way
for alternative testing strategies.

In addition to NCAM, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt extends its appreciation
to the authors of the *Guidelines for Accessible Assessments Project*
(GAAP) that were developed under an Enhanced Assessment Grant via the
United States Department of Education. The GAAP document provides
direction in the scripting and tagging of audio representation for
Common Core assessement items.

Recommendations from *the University of Kansas Audio Guidelines for
Accessible Audio* were utilized while compiling the best practices
listed in this document. The University of Kansas provided important
documentation related to audio scripting and tagging of computer-based
delivery that helped to inform the decision-making process. Their
standardized approach across thousands of items in adopting new
processes and procedures shed light upon the best practices of
implementing new strategies for acommodated learners at HMH.

Lastly, HMH authors would like to acknowledge the Northwest Evaluation
Association (NWEA) which produced the *Image Description Guidelines for
Assesment*. Their development of detailed text descriptions, especailly
concerning art commonly used in math education, allows students to
access subject material that might otherwise be inaccessible.

The contents of this document continue to grow as new technological
advacements emerge and research is conducted to better understands the
needs of unique learners. The current guidelines for scripting
mathematics audio are a result of a collaborative effort among
assessment and subject matter experts in various grade levels at HMH.
They are not meant to be restrictive, but rather to enhanace the
engagement level among all learners.

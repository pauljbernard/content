## California Assessment System

**CAASPP (California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress):**
- Grade 11: Smarter Balanced (English Language Arts/Literacy, Mathematics)
- Grade 11: California Science Test (CAST)

**Note:** No longer required for graduation (as of recent years), but used for school accountability

**College/Career Indicator (CCI):**
- Measures college and career readiness
- Factors: A-G completion, AP/IB, CTE pathway, dual enrollment, SBAC scores

---

## State-Specific Considerations

**California Common Core State Standards (CCSS):** Math and ELA
**Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS):** Science
**History-Social Science Framework:** Social Studies
**CA ELD Standards:** English Language Development for English Learners

**Integrated vs. Traditional Math:**
- Traditional pathway: Algebra I → Geometry → Algebra II
- Integrated pathway: Math I → Math II → Math III

**Social Justice and Equity:**
- California emphasizes culturally responsive pedagogy
- Ethnic Studies graduation requirement (phasing in)

---

## College Admission (UC/CSU)

**UC and CSU Admission:**
- Minimum A-G completion with C or better in each course
- Competitive GPA (varies by campus and major)
- SAT/ACT optional (test-blind for UC, test-optional for CSU as of 2023)

**Automatic Admission:**
- Top 9% of CA high school graduates eligible for CSU (not specific campus)
- Top 9% statewide eligible for UC (not specific campus)

**Recommended Preparation:**
- Complete A-G with honors/AP/IB courses
- 4 years Math (through Pre-Calculus or Calculus)
- 3+ years Science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics)
- 3+ years World Language

## Quick Reference

**Every California HS Material Must:**
- Align to CA CCSS (Math/ELA), NGSS (Science), or CA History-Social Science Framework
- Support A-G requirements for UC/CSU eligibility
- Include CA ELD Standards for English Learners
- Emphasize college and career readiness
- Address social justice and equity (increasingly important)

**Key Point:** California emphasizes A-G completion as measure of college readiness. Materials must prepare students for UC/CSU eligibility while supporting diverse learners.

   When you finish, review your work before submitting.
   ```

### Reference Sheet (Provided to All Students)

```
TRIANGLE CONGRUENCE POSTULATES AND THEOREMS

Postulate: SSS (Side-Side-Side)
If three sides of one triangle are congruent to three sides of another triangle,
then the triangles are congruent.

Postulate: SAS (Side-Angle-Side)
If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are congruent to two sides
and the included angle of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

Postulate: ASA (Angle-Side-Angle)
If two angles and the included side of one triangle are congruent to two angles
and the included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

Theorem: AAS (Angle-Angle-Side)
If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are congruent to two angles
and a non-included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

Theorem: HL (Hypotenuse-Leg) for Right Triangles Only
If the hypotenuse and a leg of one right triangle are congruent to the hypotenuse
and a leg of another right triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

DEFINITIONS

Congruent segments: Segments with equal length (AB ≅ CD means AB = CD)
Congruent angles: Angles with equal measure (∠A ≅ ∠B means m∠A = m∠B)
Included angle: The angle between two sides
Included side: The side between two angles
```

## Test Security & Ethical Use

### Before Assessment:
- Store test materials securely (locked cabinet)
- Do not share test items with students prior to administration
- Train proctors on administration procedures

### During Assessment:
- Monitor actively to prevent cheating
- Collect all materials at end of session
- Document any irregularities or accommodations provided

### After Assessment:
- Score promptly and return results within 1 week
- Provide feedback to students on areas of strength and growth
- Store completed assessments securely
- Do not publish test items publicly (maintain assessment security for future use)

### Ethical Considerations:
- Use assessment results formatively (to improve instruction), not punitively
- Combine with other evidence of learning (not sole determinant of grade)
- Provide timely feedback and opportunities for revision/retake if appropriate
- Respect student privacy (do not share individual results publicly)

## Appendix A: Sample Scored Responses

### Item 4: Vertical Angles Proof - Score 4 (Exemplar)

**Student Response**:

```
TWO-COLUMN PROOF:

Statements                          | Reasons
------------------------------------|----------------------------------------
1. AX ≅ CX                          | 1. Given
2. BX ≅ DX                          | 2. Given
3. ∠AXB ≅ ∠CXD                      | 3. Vertical Angles Theorem
4. △AXB ≅ △CXD                      | 4. SAS Postulate (statements 1, 3, 2)
```

**Scorer Comments**: Complete, correct proof. Student correctly identified vertical angles and cited the theorem. SAS Postulate appropriately applied with correct statement references. Score: 4/4

---

### Item 4: Vertical Angles Proof - Score 3

**Student Response**:

```
Statements                          | Reasons
------------------------------------|----------------------------------------
1. AX ≅ CX, BX ≅ DX                 | 1. Given
2. ∠AXB ≅ ∠CXD                      | 2. Vertical angles are equal
3. △AXB ≅ △CXD                      | 3. SAS
```

**Scorer Comments**: Mostly correct reasoning. Student recognizes vertical angles but doesn't formally cite "Vertical Angles Theorem" (uses informal language "are equal"). Combines given statements in one step (acceptable). Abbreviates postulate but applies correctly. Minor deduction for informal language. Score: 3/4

---

### Item 4: Vertical Angles Proof - Score 2

**Student Response**:

```
Statements                          | Reasons
------------------------------------|----------------------------------------
1. AX ≅ CX                          | 1. Given
2. BX ≅ DX                          | 2. Given
3. △AXB ≅ △CXD                      | 3. SSS Postulate
```

**Scorer Comments**: Partial understanding. Student identifies given sides but does not recognize or use vertical angles. Incorrectly applies SSS (only two sides congruent, not three). Demonstrates some proof structure but significant conceptual gap. Score: 2/4

---

### Item 4: Vertical Angles Proof - Score 1

**Student Response**:

```
The triangles are congruent because AX and CX are the same and BX and DX are the same.
They share point X so they must be congruent.
```

**Scorer Comments**: Minimal understanding. Student recognizes some congruent parts but does not construct a formal proof. No identification of vertical angles. Reasoning is incomplete (sharing a point does not prove congruence). Does not use proper notation or structure. Score: 1/4

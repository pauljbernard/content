---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Session 3):

1. **Create 5-7 more files** (Priority: MLR completion, Scoring Rubrics, Accessibility start)
2. **Reach 40-45% knowledge base completion**
3. **Document file manifest for migration**

### Week 2:

4. **Restructure knowledge base** (new directory structure)
5. **Create curriculum configuration system**
6. **Migrate existing 20-25 files** to new structure
7. **Add minimal multi-curriculum knowledge** (test extensibility)
8. **Complete remaining knowledge files** (reach 75-80%)

### Week 3:

9. **Complete final files** (reach 95-100%)
10. **Build knowledge embeddings** for retrieval
11. **Create usage documentation**
12. **Prepare for Phase 2** (generic skill development)

---

**Recommendation:** Continue excellent pace. Quality is outstanding, Texas compliance section is complete, MLR foundation is strong. In next session, focus on completing MLR section, adding scoring rubrics, and starting accessibility section. Then restructure in Week 2 for multi-curriculum support.

---

**Architecture Note:** The multi-district, multi-subject architecture approved in this session positions the knowledge base for significant expansion beyond HMH Math TX. With minimal additional work, the system will support:
- California Math
- Florida Math
- Texas ELA
- Texas Science
- And future combinations

The investment in proper architecture now will save months of refactoring later.

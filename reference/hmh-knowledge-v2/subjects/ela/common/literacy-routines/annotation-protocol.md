# Annotation Protocol
**Literacy Routine for Active Reading and Text Interaction**
**Scope:** Subject-Common (all ELA programs, all districts)
**Audience:** Curriculum developers creating reading comprehension lessons

---

## Overview

**Annotation** is the practice of marking text while reading to track thinking, identify key ideas, note questions, and make connections. It transforms passive reading into active engagement with text.

**Core Principle:** Writing while reading deepens comprehension, creates a record of thinking, and supports discussion and analysis.

**Literacy Routine Type:** Interpretive (reading closely and thinking visibly)

---

## Purpose and Benefits

### Why Teach Annotation?

**For All Students:**
- Makes thinking visible
- Increases focus and engagement
- Creates reference points for discussion and writing
- Develops metacognitive awareness
- Supports memory and review

**For Emergent Bilinguals:**
- Slows reading pace (more processing time)
- Provides visual/written record to refer back to
- Reduces memory load (don't have to remember everything)
- Supports oral discussion (annotations become talk prompts)
- Allows tracking vocabulary needs

**For Teachers:**
- Window into student thinking
- Formative assessment of comprehension
- Identifies patterns (what students notice/miss)
- Supports differentiation

## Annotation System

### Basic Annotation Marks (Universal Symbols)

**Core Set (appropriate for all grades):**

| Mark | Purpose | Example Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Underline** | Key ideas, important information | Underline main idea or thesis |
| **Circle** | Important words, unknown vocabulary | Circle "photosynthesis" |
| **Box** | Key facts, numbers, dates, names | Box "1776" or "Abraham Lincoln" |
| **Star ★** | Really important, surprising, interesting | Star a key quote |
| **Question Mark ?** | Confusion, questions, wondering | "Why did he do that?" |
| **Exclamation !** | Surprising, powerful, interesting | "Wow, didn't expect that!" |
| **Arrow →** | Connections, cause/effect | Connect related ideas |

---

### Extended Marks (Grades 3-8)

| Mark | Purpose | Example Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Bracket [ ]** | Important passages, key sections | Bracket paragraph with main claim |
| **Wavy Line ~~~** | Language worth discussing (literary devices) | Note figurative language |
| **+ Plus** | Agree, positive reaction | Mark point you agree with |
| **- Minus** | Disagree, negative reaction | Mark questionable claim |
| **# Hashtag** | Theme or big idea | #perseverance, #justice |

---

### Margin Notes (Beyond Symbols)

**Types of Margin Notes:**

**1. Summary/Gist**
- "This paragraph is about..." (right margin)
- Chunk summaries for longer texts

**2. Questions**
- "Why does the character...?"
- "What does this mean?"
- "How does this connect to...?"

**3. Connections**
- "This reminds me of..." (text-to-text, text-to-self, text-to-world)
- "Similar to when..."

**4. Reactions**
- "I think..."
- "This shows..."
- "Surprising because..."

**5. Analysis**
- "Author's purpose: convince readers that..."
- "Tone: frustrated"
- "Foreshadowing?"

---

## Teaching Annotation: Step-by-Step

### Initial Introduction (Grade 3 or first-time users)

**Lesson 1: Why Annotate?**

1. **Show unannotated vs. annotated text**
   - Display same text, one blank, one with annotations
   - Discuss: "Which reader was more actively engaged? How do you know?"

2. **Explain Purpose**
   - "Annotation helps us think while we read"
   - "It's like having a conversation with the text"
   - "Your marks and notes help you remember and discuss what you read"

3. **Introduce 3-4 Basic Marks**
   - Start simple: Underline, Circle, Star, Question Mark
   - Create anchor chart
   - Model each mark with example

4. **Guided Practice**
   - Short, accessible text (1 paragraph)
   - Teacher thinks aloud while annotating
   - Students practice same text
   - Share and discuss

---

### Lesson 2-3: Building the System

**Add marks gradually:**
- Week 1: Underline, Circle, Star, ?
- Week 2: Add Box, !, →
- Week 3: Add Brackets, margin notes
- Week 4+: Student choice and independence

**Practice Cycle:**
1. Introduce new mark
2. Model its use
3. Guided practice
4. Independent practice
5. Share and refine

---

### Ongoing Use

**Frequency:**
- Annotate during all close reading
- Annotate during independent reading (when appropriate)
- Build habit across content areas (not just ELA)

**Consistency:**
- Use same system across units
- Anchor chart always visible
- Reference annotations during discussion
- Celebrate effective annotations

---

## Purpose-Driven Annotation

### Annotation for Different Reading Purposes

**Close Reading for Main Idea:**
- Underline topic sentences
- Circle repeated words/phrases (signal importance)
- Bracket key paragraphs
- Margin note: Gist of each paragraph

**Close Reading for Author's Craft:**
- Wavy underline figurative language
- Star powerful word choices
- Margin note: Effect of technique
- Arrow connecting related literary elements

**Close Reading for Argument:**
- Box claim
- Underline reasons
- Circle evidence
- ? for weak/missing evidence
- +/- for agree/disagree with reasoning

**Reading for Theme:**
- Underline character actions revealing theme
- Star turning points
- # Hashtag potential themes
- Margin note: What this reveals about theme

---

## Grade-Level Progression

### Grades K-2: Pre-Annotation

**Focus:** Oral annotation, sticky notes, drawing

**Strategies:**
- Teacher models thinking aloud (annotation language without writing)
- Students use sticky notes with symbols (★, ?, !)
- Drawing responses instead of written notes
- "I notice..." and "I wonder..." stems

**Example:**
- Teacher: "I'm going to put a star here because this is important"
- Students place star sticker or sticky note

---

### Grades 3-5: Building Independence

**Focus:** Systematic annotation with basic marks + simple margin notes

**Expectations:**
- Use 5-7 annotation marks consistently
- Write brief margin notes (phrases, not sentences)
- Annotation supports discussion participation
- Begin choosing purposeful marks

**Scaffolds:**
- Annotation guide/bookmark with symbols
- Sentence frames for margin notes
- Teacher models regularly
- Practice with short texts before longer

**Example Margin Note (Grade 4):**
"Main idea: habitats are important"

---

### Grades 6-8: Sophisticated Analysis

**Focus:** Purposeful annotation, analytical notes, theme tracking

**Expectations:**
- Choose marks based on reading purpose
- Write substantive margin notes (analysis, not just summary)
- Track themes across text
- Synthesize annotations into written responses

**Scaffolds (fade over time):**
- Purpose-specific annotation guides
- Model analytical margin notes
- Peer sharing of annotations

**Example Margin Note (Grade 8):**
"Author uses irony here to criticize society's obsession with appearance. Connects to earlier scene where..."

---

## Annotation Tools and Formats

### Print Text Annotation

**Options:**
1. **Direct Annotation** (if permitted to mark text)
   - Use pencil for easy erasing/changing
   - Use different colors for different purposes (optional)

2. **Sticky Notes** (if can't write in book)
   - Place notes in margins
   - Use tab notes for flagging pages

## Annotation Quality: What to Look For

### Effective Annotations Show:

**1. Active Engagement**
- Marks throughout text (not just first page)
- Variety of marks used
- Questions and reactions evident

**2. Comprehension**
- Key ideas underlined/bracketed
- Gist notes accurate
- Questions show engagement with meaning

**3. Analysis (Grades 6-8)**
- Move beyond summary to interpretation
- Notice author's craft
- Make connections across text

**4. Purposeful Use**
- Marks match reading goal
- Not random marking (highlighting everything = highlighting nothing)
- Strategic, selective annotation

---

### Ineffective Annotations:

**1. Over-Marking**
- Entire paragraphs highlighted/underlined
- Everything marked (nothing stands out)
- **Fix:** Teach selectivity - "Mark only most important"

**2. Under-Marking**
- Blank pages, no engagement
- Only 1-2 marks in entire text
- **Fix:** Set minimum expectations (e.g., 3 marks per page)

**3. Marks Without Thinking**
- Random underlines
- Same mark used for everything
- **Fix:** Reteach purpose of each mark

**4. Surface-Level Only (Older Students)**
- Only summary notes, no analysis
- No questions or connections
- **Fix:** Model analytical annotations, require depth

---

## Assessment with Annotations

### Formative Assessment

**Check Annotations for:**
- Understanding of main ideas
- Identification of key vocabulary
- Questions showing engagement
- Misconceptions to address

**During Reading:**
- Circulate and observe annotations
- Conference with students about marks
- Note patterns across class

**After Reading:**
- Collect and review (not grade, just assess)
- Identify who needs reteaching
- Celebrate strong examples

---

### Using Annotations in Discussion

**Think-Pair-Share with Annotations:**
1. Students review their annotations (Think)
2. Share annotations with partner (Pair)
3. Report key findings to class (Share)

**Annotation Gallery Walk:**
1. Display annotated texts around room
2. Students tour and notice effective annotations
3. Discuss patterns and strong examples

**Annotation-Based Writing:**
- Use annotations as pre-writing
- Annotations become outline for response
- Cite annotated evidence in essays

**See Also:** `/subjects/ela/common/literacy-routines/think-pair-share.md`

## Common Annotation Mistakes and Fixes

### ❌ Mistake 1: No Explicit Teaching

**Problem:** Teacher says "Annotate this text" without teaching how

**Fix:**
- Teach system explicitly (introduce marks one at a time)
- Model extensively before expecting independence
- Provide anchor charts and guides

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Too Many Marks at Once

**Problem:** Overwhelming students with 15 different marks on day 1

**Fix:**
- Start with 3-4 basic marks
- Add gradually over weeks
- Prioritize quality over quantity of mark types

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Never Referencing Annotations

**Problem:** Students annotate but annotations are never used

**Fix:**
- Explicitly use annotations in discussion
- Base writing assignments on annotations
- Collect and provide feedback periodically

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Grading Annotations as "Right/Wrong"

**Problem:** Annotations are thinking, not answers - penalizing "wrong" thinking discourages risk

**Fix:**
- Assess for engagement and effort, not correctness
- Feedback, not grades
- Celebrate diverse thinking

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: No Modeling After Initial Introduction

**Problem:** Teach once, expect forever

**Fix:**
- Model regularly (every close reading)
- Share student examples
- Refresh skills periodically

---

## Annotation Across Content Areas

### Math Annotation

**Annotating Word Problems:**
- Circle numbers
- Underline what the question asks
- Box operation keywords (total, difference, per, etc.)
- Draw diagrams in margins

---

### Science Annotation

**Annotating Informational Text:**
- Underline claims
- Circle evidence/data
- Box key terminology
- Margin notes: summarize experiments

---

### Social Studies Annotation

**Annotating Primary Sources:**

**Remember:** Annotation is not busywork—it's a thinking tool. The marks and notes students make while reading become the foundation for discussion, analysis, and writing. Teach the system explicitly, model continuously, and use annotations purposefully. When annotation becomes a habit, students become more active, engaged, and strategic readers.

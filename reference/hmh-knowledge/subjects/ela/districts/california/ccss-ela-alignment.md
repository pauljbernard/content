# CCSS-ELA Alignment Guide
**Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts & Literacy**
**Source:** California Department of Education
**Applies To:** K-8 ELA (California only)

---

## Overview

**California uses CCSS-ELA (Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts & Literacy)** as its content standards for K-8 ELA. All instructional materials must explicitly align to CCSS-ELA standards.

**Core Principle:** Every lesson and activity must align to specific CCSS-ELA standards with clear evidence of alignment.

## Alignment Documentation

### Required Elements:

**1. CCSS-ELA Standard(s)**
```
CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.5.3
Compare and contrast two or more characters, settings, or events in a story
or drama, drawing on specific details in the text (e.g., how characters
interact).
```

**2. CCR Anchor Standard Connection**
```
CCR.R.3: Analyze how and why individuals, events, or ideas develop and
interact over the course of a text.
```

**3. ELD Connection** (for EB support)
```
ELD.PI.5.6: Explain ideas, phenomena, or text relationships based on
close reading with moderate support.
```

**4. Evidence of Alignment**
Describe how lesson activities address the standard

---

## Example Alignment (Grade 5 Character Comparison):

**Standard:**
```
CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.5.3
Compare and contrast two or more characters, settings, or events in a story
or drama, drawing on specific details in the text.
```

**Lesson Alignment:**
- **Read-Aloud:** Students listen to chapter book, noting character actions
- **Close Reading:** Students identify character traits with textual evidence
- **Compare/Contrast:** Students use Venn diagram to compare two characters
- **Writing:** Students write comparison paragraph with evidence from text

**CCR Connection:**
- CCR.R.3: Students analyze how characters develop through story events

**ELD Addressed:**
- ELD.PI.5.6: Students explain character relationships with moderate support
- ELD.PI.5.11: Students justify opinions about characters with evidence

**Literacy Routines Used:**
- Close Reading Protocol (analyzing character traits)
- Annotation Protocol (marking character evidence)
- Think-Pair-Share (discussing character comparisons)

## Text Complexity Triangle

**CCSS-ELA Unique Feature:** Explicit text complexity guidance

### Three Dimensions:

**1. Quantitative Measures:**
- Lexile Level (Grade 2-3: 450L-790L)
- ATOS Level (Grade 5: 4.5-5.5)
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level

**2. Qualitative Measures:**
- Levels of Meaning (single vs. multiple levels)
- Structure (chronological vs. complex)
- Language Conventionality (literal vs. figurative)
- Knowledge Demands (common vs. specialized)

**3. Reader and Task:**
- Motivation
- Knowledge
- Experiences
- Purpose for reading
- Questions posed

**Example Grade 5:**
- Lexile Range: 740L-1010L
- Complexity: Moderate to high
- Support: Scaffolded instruction with challenging texts

---

## Differences from TEKS ELA

### CCSS-ELA Emphasizes:

**Text-Dependent Questions:**
- Questions must be answerable from text alone
- No "What did you do last summer?" questions
- Focus on close reading and evidence

**Text Complexity:**
- Students read grade-level complex texts
- Stretch texts with scaffolding
- Less reliance on leveled readers

**Fewer, Clearer Standards:**
- ~40 standards per grade vs. TEKS 60+
- Broader standards require depth
- More room for teacher professional judgment

**Evidence-Based Writing:**
- All writing anchored in reading
- Cite textual evidence explicitly
- Integrate reading and writing

- **UDL** - Same principles (universal)
- **EB Scaffolding** - Same strategies (universal, adapted for ELD)
- **CEID** - Same diversity guidelines (universal)
- **WCAG** - Same accessibility requirements (universal)

### What's Different (CA-Specific):

- **Standard codes and format** - CCSS-ELA vs. TEKS ELA
- **Language standards** - ELD vs. ELPS
- **Text complexity** - CCSS explicit triangle vs. TEKS
- **CCR Anchor Standards** - CCSS unique feature

**Reuse Rate:** ~90% (most guidance is universal, only standards differ)

## CCSS-ELA Grade Band Progressions

### Reading Literature (RL) - Standard 3 Progression:

**K:** With prompting, identify characters, settings, major events
**1:** Describe characters, settings, major events using key details
**2:** Describe how characters respond to major events
**3:** Describe characters and explain how their actions contribute to sequence
**4:** Describe character, setting, event in depth (thoughts, words, actions)
**5:** Compare/contrast characters, settings, events
**6:** Describe how plot unfolds and how characters respond/change
**7:** Analyze how elements interact (setting shapes characters)
**8:** Analyze how dialogue/incidents propel action/reveal character

**Key Pattern:** Complexity increases from describe → compare → analyze

**Remember:** CCSS-ELA and TEKS ELA teach similar literacy skills but with different standard codes, organization, and emphasis (text complexity, CCR anchors). The pedagogical approaches (literacy routines, UDL, DOK) remain the same, allowing 90%+ knowledge reuse across states.

## Key Facts

| Aspect | Washington |
|--------|------------|
| **Content Standards** | WA State Learning Standards - CCSS-based |
| **Language Standards** | WA ELD Standards (state-specific) |
| **Adoption Process** | State-reviewed + local selection |
| **Compliance** | OSPI review process |
| **Science Standards** | WA Science Standards (NGSS-based) |
| **Assessment** | SBA (Smarter Balanced) - Math/ELA |
| **EL Assessment** | ELPA21 assessment |

---

## Washington State Learning Standards

**Mathematics:**
- Washington State Learning Standards for Mathematics
- Based on CCSS-M (95%+ identical)

**ELA:**
- Washington State Learning Standards for English Language Arts
- Based on CCSS-ELA

**Science:**
- Washington State K-12 Learning Standards for Science (2013)
- Based on NGSS

---

## English Learner Support

**Washington uses state-specific ELD standards:**
- Washington State K-12 ELD Standards
- Based on similar frameworks as CA ELD
- 5 proficiency levels
- ELPA21 assessment (English Language Proficiency Assessment)

**Note:** NOT a WIDA state (uses ELPA21 consortium instead)

**See:** `/districts/washington/language/washington-eld-standards.md` for complete guidance

---

## State Review Process

**Washington reviews and rates instructional materials:**
- OSPI convenes review committees
- Materials rated (Highly Aligned, Aligned, Partially Aligned)
- Districts select from reviewed materials
- Multi-year adoption cycles

**Similar to NC and CA models**

---

## Knowledge Reuse (95%+)

**Reused:** CCSS-M, NGSS, MLRs, assessment files, universal frameworks

**WA-Specific:** WA ELD Standards (similar structure to CA ELD), ELPA21 assessment

---

## Implementation Notes

**Standards:** WA.Math.5.NF.A.1 ≈ CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.A.1

**Language:** WA ELD proficiency levels, integrated scaffolds

**Assessment:** Smarter Balanced (SBA) for Math/ELA

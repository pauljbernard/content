# Emergent Bilingual (EB) Scaffolding Guide
**Source:** Emergent Bilinguals Guidelines.docx
**Alignment:** ELPS (English Language Proficiency Standards)
**Required Proficiency Levels:** 3 (Emerging, Expanding, Bridging)

## Overview

Emergent Bilingual (EB) support in Into Math TX uses an **asset-based approach** that views students' home languages and cultural backgrounds as strengths, not deficits. All lessons must provide differentiated scaffolds for three proficiency levels.

**Philosophy:** Language learners bring valuable linguistic and cultural resources. Support should build on these assets while developing academic English.

---

## The 3 Proficiency Levels

### 1. Emerging (Pre-Production / Beginning)
**Also Known As:** Beginning, Pre-Production, Level 1
**Characteristics:**
- Limited English vocabulary
- May use single words or short phrases
- Heavy reliance on visuals and gestures
- Silent period is common and acceptable
- Benefit from native language support

### 2. Expanding (Intermediate)
**Also Known As:** Intermediate, Developing, Level 2-3
**Characteristics:**
- Growing vocabulary
- Can form simple sentences
- Beginning to use academic language
- May mix languages (code-switching)
- Need structured support for complex language

### 3. Bridging (High Intermediate / Advanced)
**Also Known As:** Advanced, High Intermediate, Level 4-5
**Characteristics:**
- Near grade-level proficiency
- Can engage in academic discourse
- Still developing specialized vocabulary
- Need support for complex grammatical structures
- Benefit from opportunities to refine and expand language

## Scaffold Types by Level

### Emerging Level Scaffolds

**Sentence Starters (Speaking):**
- "I see ___."
- "The answer is ___."
- "I think ___."
- "___ and ___ make ___."

**Visual Supports (Representing):**
- Heavily rely on manipulatives
- Use gestures and acting out
- Provide completed examples
- Allow pointing/showing instead of telling

**Word Banks (Writing):**
- Key vocabulary with pictures
- Number words
- Operation words (add, subtract, equal)
- Native language cognates when available

**Listening Supports:**
- Demonstrate actions while speaking
- Use very simple, clear language
- Speak slowly with pauses
- Check understanding with gestures (thumbs up/down)

**Example Emerging Scaffold (SYL):**
```
Language Proficiency Level: Emerging

Scaffolded Examples: Provide manipulatives (triangles and squares). Ask
students to show how to make a house using the shapes. Accept pointing and
gesturing. Use sentence starter: "I use ___ to make a house."
```

---

### Expanding Level Scaffolds

**Sentence Frames (Speaking/Writing):**
- "I notice that ___."
- "First I ___, then I ___."
- "My strategy is to ___."
- "___ is the same as ___ because ___."
- "I agree/disagree because ___."

**Structured Talk Moves (Speaking):**
- Turn and talk with specific prompts
- Revoicing: "I heard you say ___. Is that right?"
- Partner explanations
- Complete a partner's thought

**Graphic Organizers (Representing):**
- Partially completed organizers
- Step-by-step visual guides
- Tables with headers provided
- Venn diagrams for comparing

**Academic Vocabulary Development (Listening/Speaking):**
- Pre-teach 2-3 key terms
- Connect to cognates
- Use in multiple contexts
- Practice pronunciation

**Example Expanding Scaffold (SYL):**
```
Language Proficiency Level: Expanding

Scaffolded Examples: Have students work with a partner to describe the shapes
needed. Provide sentence frame: "To make a house, I need ___ triangles and ___
squares. First I ___, then I ___." Encourage students to show and explain
their thinking.
```

---

### Bridging Level Scaffolds

**Extended Discourse (Speaking):**
- Explain reasoning fully
- Compare multiple strategies
- Justify choices
- Ask clarifying questions of peers

**Academic Language Refinement (Writing/Speaking):**
- Use precise mathematical vocabulary
- Transition words (however, therefore, because)
- Complex sentence structures
- Multiple representations

**Critical Thinking Prompts (All Domains):**
- "Why do you think...?"
- "What if we changed...?"
- "How is this similar to/different from...?"
- "Can you prove...?"

**Peer Leadership (Speaking):**
- Explain to a partner
- Justify disagreement respectfully
- Teach strategy to emerging/expanding student
- Lead small group discussion

**Example Bridging Scaffold (SYL):**
```
Language Proficiency Level: Bridging

Scaffolded Examples: Ask students to explain multiple ways to compose the house
shape. Encourage use of specific geometric vocabulary (triangle, square, side,
corner, compose). Have students justify why their arrangement makes a house shape
and compare their solution to a partner's approach.
```

## ELPS Alignment

Each Language Objective should reference specific ELPS:

### ELPS Structure:
**Format:** ELPS [Domain].[Level].[Standard]

**Example:** ELPS 3.D.ii
- 3 = Speaking domain
- D = Express opinions, ideas, and feelings
- ii = High Beginning/Intermediate level

### Common ELPS for Mathematics:

**Speaking (ELPS 3):**
- 3.C - Speak using content area vocabulary
- 3.D - Express opinions and feelings
- 3.E - Share information orally
- 3.G - Express opinions and ideas

**Writing (ELPS 5):**
- 5.B - Write using content area vocabulary
- 5.E - Employ increasingly complex grammatical structures
- 5.F - Write using variety of sentence types
- 5.G - Narrate, describe, explain

**Listening (ELPS 4):**
- 4.C - Develop language attentiveness
- 4.D - Use pre-reading supports
- 4.F - Use visual/contextual support
- 4.G - Demonstrate comprehension

**Representing (Cross-Cutting):**
- Often combined with Speaking or Writing ELPS
- Visual representations support all domains

## Asset-Based Language

### ✅ DO Use Asset-Based Framing:

- "Emergent bilinguals" (not "English learners" or "ELLs")
- "Home language" (not "native language" implying English is native)
- "Multilingual learners" (recognizing the asset of multiple languages)
- "Developing English proficiency" (growth mindset)
- "Language resources" (not "language barriers")

### ❌ AVOID Deficit Framing:

- "Limited English proficient"
- "Non-English speakers"
- "Language deficiencies"
- "Can't speak English"
- "Language problems"

---

## Differentiation Strategies

### For SYL Scaffolds:

**Emerging Focus:**
- Heavy visual support
- Minimal language production required
- Accept non-verbal responses
- Native language welcome
- Focus on mathematical understanding, not language perfection

**Expanding Focus:**
- Structured language frames
- Partner support
- Multiple opportunities to practice language
- Build toward academic vocabulary
- Model then practice

**Bridging Focus:**
- Refine academic language
- Push for precision
- Encourage elaboration
- Leadership opportunities
- Connect to grade-level expectations

### Scaffolding Continuum:

```
Emerging ────────► Expanding ────────► Bridging
Heavy Support              Less Support              Independence
Show/Act Out              Sentence Frames            Extended Discourse
Gestures OK               Partner Support            Justify/Compare
Word Bank                 Vocabulary Practice        Precise Language
1-2 Words                 Simple Sentences          Complex Sentences
```

---

## Common Implementation Errors

### ❌ One-Size-Fits-All Support
**Problem:** Same scaffold for all three levels
**Solution:** Differentiate by proficiency level

### ❌ Lowering Mathematical Rigor
**Problem:** Simpler math problems for EB students
**Solution:** Maintain rigor, scaffold the language

### ❌ Over-Scaffolding Advanced Students
**Problem:** Bridging students given Emerging-level support
**Solution:** Match scaffold to actual proficiency level

### ❌ Neglecting Home Language
**Problem:** English-only approach
**Solution:** Welcome and build on home language assets

### ❌ Forgetting Domain Alignment
**Problem:** Scaffold doesn't match language domain being assessed
**Solution:** If assessing speaking, scaffold speaking; if writing, scaffold writing

"Have students arrange shapes with partner and describe: 'I used ___ triangles and ___ squares. I put the triangles ___.'"

**Bridging:**
"Ask students to compare different house designs. 'My house has ___. Your house has ___. Both houses ___. They are different because ___.'"

**Bridging:**
"Compare two solution methods: 'I used ___ method because ___. Another way is ___. Both methods ___, but I prefer ___ because ___.'"

**Remember:** EB scaffolds should maintain mathematical rigor while making language accessible. The goal is mathematical understanding AND language development.

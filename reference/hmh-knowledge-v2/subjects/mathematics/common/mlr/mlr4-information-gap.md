# MLR4: Information Gap
**Mathematical Language Routine #4**
**Source:** Mathematical Language Routines (MLR) Guidelines
**Primary Use:** Specially designed activities (not standard tasks)
**Frequency:** Low (10-20% of lessons)

---

## Overview

**MLR4: Information Gap** is a structured activity where information needed to solve a problem is intentionally distributed between partners, creating a **need for communication**. Students must ask questions, share information, and use precise language to bridge the gap.

**Core Principle:** When students need information that only a partner has, they develop the language and questioning skills to access it.

---

## Purpose

To have students:
1. **Recognize** they need information they don't have
2. **Ask precise questions** to get that information
3. **Communicate clearly** to share their own information
4. **Listen carefully** to understand partner's information
5. **Request clarification** when information is unclear
6. **Use mathematical vocabulary** to be understood

**Why It Works:**
- Creates authentic need for communication (not forced)
- Motivates precise language use (ambiguity creates problems)
- Requires active listening (can't solve without it)
- Builds question-asking skills (often underdeveloped)
- Mirrors real mathematical collaboration

---

## The Information Gap Structure

### Essential Components:

**1. Problem Card (Both Partners See)**
- Describes the problem or question to solve
- Does NOT contain all information needed
- Makes clear that information is missing

**2. Data Card(s) (Only One Partner Sees)**
- Contains information needed to solve problem
- Partner with card cannot show it directly
- Must communicate information verbally

**3. Communication Requirement**
- Partner without data must ask questions
- Partner with data must explain/describe
- Both work together to solve

---

## When to Use MLR4

### Best Situations:
- ✅ Building need for precise mathematical language
- ✅ Developing question-asking skills
- ✅ When definitions or descriptions are the focus
- ✅ Practicing mathematical vocabulary in context
- ✅ When you can design genuine information gap

### Not Ideal For:
- ❌ Standard computational problems (no natural gap)
- ❌ When all information fits on one page
- ❌ Individual work (requires partners)
- ❌ Time-limited lessons (needs 15-20 minutes)
- ❌ First exposure to concept (need some foundation)

---

## Types of Information Gaps

### Type 1: Visual Description Gap
**Setup:** Partner A has image/diagram, Partner B doesn't

**Example (Grade 3):**
- **Problem Card (Both):** "Draw the shape that your partner describes."
- **Data Card (Partner A only):** [Image of pentagon with specific side lengths]
- **Gap:** Partner B must ask questions to draw shape they can't see

**Language Practice:** Shape vocabulary, position words, measurement terms

---

### Type 2: Data Retrieval Gap
**Setup:** Partner A has data table/chart, Partner B needs specific values

**Example (Grade 5):**
- **Problem Card (Both):** "What is the average rainfall for the three months with highest rainfall?"
- **Data Card (Partner A only):** [Table showing rainfall for all 12 months]
- **Gap:** Partner B must identify which three months and request values

**Language Practice:** Data vocabulary, comparison language, question formation

---

### Type 3: Definition Gap
**Setup:** Partner A has mathematical definition, Partner B must figure it out

**Example (Grade 6):**
- **Problem Card (Both):** "Determine if these ratios are equivalent: 2:3 and 8:12"
- **Data Card (Partner A only):** [Definition and examples of equivalent ratios]
- **Gap:** Partner B must ask questions to understand concept

**Language Practice:** Definition language, explanation strategies, concept vocabulary

---

### Type 4: Procedure Gap
**Setup:** Partner A has steps of procedure, Partner B needs to follow them

**Example (Grade 4):**
- **Problem Card (Both):** "Multiply 34 × 16 using the standard algorithm."
- **Data Card (Partner A only):** [Step-by-step description of algorithm]
- **Gap:** Partner B must ask for each step and execute it

**Language Practice:** Sequential language, procedural vocabulary, direction-giving

---

### Type 5: Context Gap
**Setup:** Partner A has context/scenario details, Partner B has question

**Example (Grade 7):**
- **Problem Card (Both):** "How much did the temperature change?"
- **Data Card (Partner A only):** "Temperature at 6 AM was -5°F. Temperature at 2 PM was 23°F."
- **Gap:** Partner B must request specific values

**Language Practice:** Context comprehension, question specificity, measurement language

---

## Implementation Steps

### Preparation (Teacher)

**Step 0: Design the Information Gap**
**Time:** Design phase (before lesson)

Create three components:
1. **Problem Card** - What to solve (give to both)
2. **Data Card** - Information needed (give to only one partner)
3. **Success Criteria** - How to know when solved correctly

**Key Design Principle:** Information on Data Card must be genuinely needed to solve Problem Card.

---

### Step 1: SETUP (Teacher)
**Time:** 3-5 minutes

**Explain the Structure:**
- "Partner A, you will have information that Partner B needs."
- "Partner A, you cannot show your card to Partner B."
- "Partner B, you must ask questions to get the information."
- "Work together to solve the problem."

**Distribute Materials:**
- Give Problem Card to both partners
- Give Data Card to Partner A only (face down until ready)

**Set Norms:**
- Ask questions
- Listen carefully
- Use precise language
- Request clarification if needed

---

### Step 2: INDIVIDUAL READING (Both Partners)
**Time:** 2 minutes

**Partner A:**
- Reads Problem Card
- Reads Data Card (privately)
- Thinks about what information Partner B will need

**Partner B:**
- Reads Problem Card
- Identifies what information is missing
- Thinks about what questions to ask

**Teacher Role:**
- Circulate
- Ensure Partner A isn't showing card
- Remind students not to start discussing yet

---

### Step 3: PARTNER COMMUNICATION (Pairs)
**Time:** 8-12 minutes

**Partner B asks questions to get information:**
- "What does the table show?"
- "What is the value for...?"
- "Can you describe the shape?"

**Partner A shares information (without showing card):**
- Reads or describes information
- Answers questions
- Asks clarifying questions: "What do you need to know?"

**Both partners work together to solve.**

**Teacher Role:**
- Circulate and listen
- Note effective questioning strategies
- Note precise language use
- Intervene if stuck (prompt with questions)
- Ensure Data Card stays hidden

---

### Step 4: VERIFY SOLUTION (Pairs)
**Time:** 2-3 minutes

Partners check their solution:
- Does it answer the problem?
- Does it make sense?
- Do they agree?

**Now Partner A can show Data Card** to verify accuracy.

---

### Step 5: REFLECT ON COMMUNICATION (Whole-Class)
**Time:** 5 minutes

Discuss the process:
- "What questions were most helpful?"
- "What made communication easy or difficult?"
- "What words or phrases helped you be precise?"
- "What would you do differently next time?"

**Teacher Role:**
- Highlight effective communication strategies
- Collect useful question stems
- Emphasize role of precise language
- Connect to mathematical vocabulary

---

### Step 6: ROLE SWITCH (Optional)
**Time:** 10-15 minutes

**For deeper practice:**
- Switch roles (Partner B now has Data Card)
- Use new problem with same structure
- Apply strategies learned from first round

**Benefit:** Both partners practice asking and answering

---

## Standard Implementation Text

### Full Boilerplate:

```
THEN, have students use the Information Gap routine to discuss their
thinking.

Provide each pair with Problem Card [X] and Data Card [Y]. Give Data Card
[Y] to only one partner, who should keep it hidden. The partner without
the Data Card asks questions to gather the information needed to solve the
problem, while the partner with the Data Card responds without showing it.
Emphasize the importance of asking precise questions and using mathematical
vocabulary. After solving, partners verify by comparing the Data Card to
their solution.
```

### Customization Points:

**[X] Problem Card:**
- Identifies which problem card (e.g., "Problem Card A")

**[Y] Data Card:**
- Identifies which data card (e.g., "Data Card A")

---

## Examples by Grade Band

### K-2 Example (Shape Description):

**Context:** Students practicing 2D shape vocabulary.

**Problem Card (Both Partners See):**
```
Problem: Draw the shape that your partner describes.
You will each have a different shape.
Work together to draw both shapes.
```

**Data Card (Partner A Only):**
```
Your shape is a triangle.
It has 3 sides and 3 corners.
The bottom side is 4 inches long.
```

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Information Gap routine to discuss their
thinking.

Provide each pair with a Problem Card and two Data Cards (one per partner).
Each partner keeps their Data Card hidden. Partners take turns describing
their shapes while the other partner draws. Emphasize using shape vocabulary
like sides, corners, triangle, rectangle, square. After both partners have
drawn, they reveal their Data Cards to verify accuracy.
```

**Key Questions Partner B Might Ask:**
- "How many sides does it have?"
- "What shape is it?"
- "How long are the sides?"

**Language Practiced:**
- Shape names
- Attribute vocabulary (sides, corners, length)
- Directional language

---

### 3-5 Example (Data Retrieval):

**Context:** Students working with data tables and finding averages.

**Problem Card (Both Partners See):**
```
Problem: What is the average temperature for Monday through Wednesday?

Partner A has a table showing temperatures for the week.
Partner B needs to find the average.
```

**Data Card (Partner A Only):**
```
Temperature Table:
Monday: 72°F
Tuesday: 68°F
Wednesday: 75°F
Thursday: 80°F
Friday: 77°F
```

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Information Gap routine to discuss their
thinking.

Provide each pair with a Problem Card and Data Card. Give the Data Card to
only Partner A. Partner B must ask questions to gather the temperatures for
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, then calculate the average. Emphasize asking
for specific information and using vocabulary like temperature, degrees, and
average. After solving, Partner A reveals the Data Card to verify.
```

**Key Questions Partner B Might Ask:**
- "What was the temperature on Monday?"
- "What about Tuesday?"
- "Can you tell me Wednesday's temperature?"

**Language Practiced:**
- Data vocabulary
- Specific questioning
- Temperature and measurement terms
- Average calculation language

---

### 6-8 Example (Coordinate Plane):

**Context:** Students plotting points and identifying patterns.

**Problem Card (Both Partners See):**
```
Problem: Plot the three points your partner describes, then determine if
they form a line. If so, find the slope.

Partner A has the coordinates.
Partner B will plot and analyze.
```

**Data Card (Partner A Only):**
```
Point A: (2, 5)
Point B: (4, 9)
Point C: (6, 13)
```

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Information Gap routine to discuss their
thinking.

Provide each pair with a Problem Card and Data Card. Give the Data Card to
only Partner A. Partner B must ask for the coordinates of each point, plot
them on a coordinate plane, and determine if they're collinear. If so,
Partner B calculates the slope. Emphasize using precise coordinate notation
(x-comma-y) and vocabulary like ordered pair, x-coordinate, y-coordinate,
and slope. After analysis, Partner A reveals the Data Card to verify.
```

**Key Questions Partner B Might Ask:**
- "What are the coordinates of Point A?"
- "What's the x-coordinate? What's the y-coordinate?"
- "Can you repeat the coordinates for Point B?"

**Language Practiced:**
- Coordinate notation
- Ordered pair vocabulary
- Slope language
- Collinear terminology

## Designing Effective Information Gaps

### Design Principle 1: Genuine Need

**Essential:** Information gap must be authentic, not artificial.

**Good Information Gap:**
Partner A has data table that's too complex to memorize → Partner B genuinely needs to ask questions

**Poor Information Gap:**
Partner A has answer "42" → No reason to ask questions; just say "42"

---

### Design Principle 2: Promotes Precise Language

**Essential:** Ambiguous language causes problems; precise language succeeds.

**Good Information Gap:**
Describing a shape's specific attributes requires precise vocabulary

**Poor Information Gap:**
Partner A has answer that can be communicated with a single number

---

### Design Principle 3: Multiple Questions Required

**Essential:** Information gap requires extended conversation, not one question.

**Good Information Gap:**
Multiple pieces of data needed; requires several questions

**Poor Information Gap:**
Single yes/no question reveals all information

---

### Design Principle 4: Visual Restriction

**Essential:** Information CANNOT be easily shown; must be communicated verbally.

**Good Information Gap:**
Partner A has card they cannot show; must describe

**Poor Information Gap:**
Partner A can just point or gesture to communicate

---

## Creating Information Gap Activities

### Template for Designing:

**Step 1: Identify Mathematical Goal**
- What concept/vocabulary/skill are students practicing?
- What language do you want students to use?

**Step 2: Determine What Information to Separate**
- What information is essential to solving?
- How can this information be held by one partner?

**Step 3: Design Problem Card**
- State the problem to solve
- Make clear that information is missing
- Indicate who has what

**Step 4: Design Data Card**
- Include all necessary information
- Format for easy reference
- Include more than partner needs (so they must ask specific questions)

**Step 5: Test the Gap**
- Can problem be solved without the data?
  - If YES → gap is not genuine
  - If NO → gap is authentic ✓
- Does getting data require multiple questions?
  - If NO → gap is too simple
  - If YES → gap is appropriate ✓

---

### Example: Designing a Fraction Information Gap (Grade 4)

**Mathematical Goal:** Practice fraction comparison vocabulary (greater than, less than, equivalent, numerator, denominator)

**Information to Separate:** Give Partner A several fractions; Partner B needs specific ones to compare

**Problem Card (Both):**
"Which is greater: the first fraction or the second fraction? Use <, >, or = to compare."

**Data Card (Partner A Only):**
```
Fraction Set A: 2/3, 3/4, 1/2, 5/8, 3/6
Fraction Set B: 4/6, 7/8, 2/4, 5/6, 1/3
```

**Success Criteria:**
Partner B must identify which pair to compare (e.g., "first fraction from Set A" and "second fraction from Set B"), request those specific fractions, then determine relationship.

**Test:**
- Can Partner B solve without Data Card? NO ✓
- Does it require multiple questions? YES ✓
- Does precise language matter? YES (must specify which set, which position) ✓

## Teacher Facilitation Strategies

### During Communication Phase:

**Listen For:**
- Precise vs. vague questions
- Use of mathematical vocabulary
- Clarification requests
- Breakdown in communication

**Intervene When:**
- Partners are stuck (prompt: "What information do you need?")
- Partner A is showing card (remind of rules)
- Questions are too vague (model: "Can you ask more specifically?")
- Language is informal (suggest mathematical terms)

**Celebrate When:**
- Students use precise vocabulary
- Effective questions are asked
- Students request clarification
- Communication is clear and efficient

---

### Common Facilitation Challenges:

**Challenge 1: Partner A just says the answer**

**Solution:**
- Design gap so answer isn't a single value
- Require process, not just answer
- Make Data Card contain information, not the solution

---

**Challenge 2: Partner B doesn't know what to ask**

**Solution:**
- Provide question stems: "What is...?" "Can you tell me...?" "How many...?"
- Model first information gap with whole class
- Start with simpler gaps before complex ones

---

**Challenge 3: Partner A shows the card**

**Solution:**
- Establish norm: "The card is like a secret code; you can read it but not show it"
- Position partners so card can't be seen
- Remind: "Your job is to explain, not show"

---

**Challenge 4: Communication breaks down**

**Solution:**
- Pause and troubleshoot: "What's making this difficult?"
- Ask: "What information do you need right now?"
- Prompt: "Can you ask a more specific question?"

---

## Integration with Other Supports

### MLR4 + EB Scaffolds:

**Emerging Level:**
- Provide question frames: "What is ___?" "Can you tell me ___?"
- Accept pointing/gesturing alongside verbal communication
- Partner with stronger English speaker

**Expanding Level:**
- Sentence frames for both asking and explaining
- Encourage complete sentences
- Provide vocabulary list on Problem Card

**Bridging Level:**
- Expect complete sentences and precise vocabulary
- Challenge to use multiple ways to explain
- Focus on clarity and precision

**Example Frames:**
- "Can you tell me the value for ___?"
- "What does ___ equal?"
- "The value is ___."
- "Let me repeat that: ___."

---

### MLR4 + MLR8 (Discussion Supports):

**Combination Strategy:**
Use discussion supports during information gap

**Examples:**
- Provide sentence frames for questions
- Use think-pair-share structure before communication
- Revoice effective questions for whole class
- Create reference chart of useful question stems

---

### MLR4 + UDL:

**UDL Engagement:** Authentic communication need motivates language use

**UDL Representation:** Information presented in multiple ways (visual Data Card, verbal communication)

**UDL Action & Expression:** Students express understanding through questioning and explaining

---

## Assessment Opportunities

### Formative Assessment:

**What to Observe:**
- Quality of questions (specific vs. vague)
- Use of mathematical vocabulary
- Listening and comprehension
- Ability to explain clearly
- Request for clarification when needed

**Evidence of Success:**
- ✅ Students ask specific, targeted questions
- ✅ Mathematical vocabulary used naturally
- ✅ Partners listen actively and comprehend
- ✅ Communication is clear enough to solve problem
- ✅ Students request clarification when unclear

---

### Reflection Prompts:

**For Students:**
- "What question helped you the most? Why?"
- "What made it easy or hard to communicate?"
- "What words helped you be precise?"
- "What would you ask differently next time?"

---

## Time Management

### Typical Timing:

**Total Time:** 20-25 minutes (longer than most MLRs)

| Step | Time | Activity |
|------|------|----------|
| Setup & Explain | 3-5 min | Teacher explains structure |
| Individual Reading | 2 min | Both partners read cards |
| Partner Communication | 8-12 min | Information exchange & solve |
| Verify Solution | 2-3 min | Check with Data Card |
| Whole-Class Reflection | 5 min | Discuss strategies |
| **Total** | **20-27 min** | **Complete routine** |

---

### Shortened Version (Not Recommended):

Information Gap is already a specialized routine. Shortening it significantly reduces its effectiveness.

**Minimum Time:** 15 minutes
- Setup: 2 minutes
- Communication: 10 minutes
- Reflection: 3 minutes

**Trade-off:** Less time for reflection on language use

---

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Students Who Struggle with Questioning:

**Scaffold:**
- Provide question stems on cards
- Model first question for them
- Partner with strong questioner
- Start with simpler gaps (fewer pieces of information)

---

### For Advanced Students:

**Challenge:**
- More complex information gaps (multiple layers)
- Time constraint (must communicate efficiently)
- Role as "consultant" helping other pairs
- Design their own information gap activity

---

### For Emergent Bilinguals:

**Support:**
- Provide vocabulary list with Problem Card
- Allow use of native language to clarify
- Provide bilingual partner when possible
- Accept non-verbal communication (pointing, drawing) alongside verbal

---

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Gap is not genuine
**Problem:** Partner B can solve without Partner A's information
**Solution:** Ensure Data Card contains essential information

### ❌ Mistake 2: Answer is too simple
**Problem:** Partner A says "42" and activity is over
**Solution:** Data Card should contain information, not the answer

### ❌ Mistake 3: No reflection on language
**Problem:** Activity ends after solving; no discussion of communication
**Solution:** Always include reflection on what language/questions worked

### ❌ Mistake 4: Overuse
**Problem:** Information gap every lesson (takes too much time, loses novelty)
**Solution:** Use strategically 10-20% of lessons, when authentic gap exists

### ❌ Mistake 5: Partners can't communicate
**Problem:** Language barrier too high; frustration builds
**Solution:** Provide sentence frames, vocabulary support, bilingual partners

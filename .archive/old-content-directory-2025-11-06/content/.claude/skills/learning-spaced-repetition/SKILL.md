# Learning Spaced Repetition
Optimize long-term retention through scientifically-spaced review schedules.
## When to Use: Language learning, medical education, factual knowledge, certification prep
## Algorithms: Leitner system, SM-2, adaptive intervals based on performance
## CLI: /learning.spaced-repetition --content "vocabulary-list.csv" --algorithm "SM-2"
## Output: Flashcard decks, review schedules, retention predictions
## Exit Codes: 0=success, 1=invalid algorithm, 2=insufficient content

# Washington ELD Standards
**Washington State K-12 English Language Development Standards**
**Source:** Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI)
**Applies To:** K-12 (Washington only)

---

## Overview

**Washington has state-specific ELD standards** (not WIDA). The framework is similar to California ELD and other state ELD standards, with integrated language development in content instruction.

**Assessment:** ELPA21 (English Language Proficiency Assessment for the 21st Century)

**Core Principle:** English Learners access grade-level content while developing English proficiency through scaffolded instruction.

## WA ELD vs. Other States

| Aspect | Washington | California | WIDA States |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Proficiency Levels** | 5 levels (1-5) | 3 levels | 6 levels (1.0-6.0) |
| **Assessment** | ELPA21 | ELPAC | ACCESS for ELLs |
| **Organization** | Integrated with content | 3 Parts | 5 Standards |
| **Framework** | Similar to CA ELD | CA-specific | Multi-state |

**Similarity:** All frameworks require scaffolding at multiple proficiency levels integrated with content standards.

## WA ELD Proficiency Levels

### Five Levels:

**Level 1: Entering**
- Minimal English proficiency
- Single words, short phrases
- Heavy reliance on visuals and native language

**Level 2: Emerging**
- Limited English proficiency
- Simple sentences
- Frequent errors

**Level 3: Developing**
- Developing English proficiency
- Compound sentences emerging
- Errors less frequent

**Level 4: Expanding**
- Strong English proficiency
- Complex sentences
- Academic vocabulary developing

**Level 5: Bridging**
- Advanced English proficiency, approaching grade-level
- Sophisticated language
- Minimal errors

## Scaffolding by Proficiency Level

### Mathematics Example: Grade 5 Fractions

**Problem:** "Maria has 3/4 of a pizza. She gives 1/4 to her friend. How much pizza does Maria have left?"

**Level 1 (Entering):**
- Visual: Fraction circles
- Sentence frame: "Maria has ___ left."
- Word bank with pictures
- Partner with visual manipulatives

**Level 2 (Emerging):**
- Visual model with equation
- Sentence frames: "First, Maria had ___. Then, she ___."
- Vocabulary support: left = remaining
- Think-Pair-Share

**Level 3 (Developing):**
- Optional visual support
- Sentence starter: "To solve, first I ___"
- Academic vocabulary: subtract, difference, equivalent
- Small group discussion

**Level 4 (Expanding):**
- Minimal scaffolds
- Encourage precise vocabulary
- Full class participation
- Explain reasoning

**Level 5 (Bridging):**
- Grade-level expectations
- Academic language refinement
- Extended explanations
- May support lower-level students

## WA ELD and Mathematical Language Routines

**MLRs provide the language scaffolds for WA ELD integration:**

**MLR1, MLR2, MLR6, MLR8** - All support language development at WA ELD proficiency levels

**See:** `/subjects/mathematics/common/mlr/` for all 8 MLR files

**Application:**
- Levels 1-2: Heavy scaffolds (sentence frames, visuals)
- Levels 3-4: Moderate scaffolds (graphic organizers, vocabulary)
- Levels 4-5: Light scaffolds (academic language models)

---

## Implementation Notes

### Required Elements in Lessons:

**1. Content Standard (WA State Learning Standard)**
```
WA.Math.5.NF.A.1
Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators
```

**2. Language Objective**
```
Students will explain their strategy using "first," "then," and "common denominator."
```

**3. Proficiency-Level Scaffolds**
- Document scaffolds for Levels 1-5
- Differentiate language support, not content rigor

**4. Instructional Routine**
- MLR or literacy routine supporting language development

---

## Universal Scaffolding Strategies (Reused)

**All WA ELD levels benefit from:**

- **Visual Supports:** Diagrams, models, graphic organizers
- **Sentence Frames:** Differentiated by level
- **Vocabulary Support:** Word walls, cognates, visuals
- **Cooperative Learning:** Structured protocols

**See Also:** `/universal/frameworks/eb-scaffolding-guide.md`

---

## WA ELD and UDL Connection

**ELD scaffolds align with UDL principles:**

- **Engagement:** Culturally relevant contexts
- **Representation:** Multiple visual/linguistic supports
- **Action/Expression:** Multiple response options

**See Also:** `/universal/frameworks/udl-principles-guide.md`

---

## Quick Reference by Level

**Level 1:** Heavy scaffolds - visuals, frames, bilingual support

**Level 2:** Strong scaffolds - visuals, frames, vocabulary

**Level 3:** Moderate scaffolds - optional visuals, sentence starters

**Level 4:** Light scaffolds - encourage precision, minimal frames

**Level 5:** Minimal scaffolds - academic language refinement

**Remember:** Washington ELD standards are state-specific but follow similar principles to other ELD frameworks. Use 5 proficiency levels (1-5) with differentiated scaffolds. MLRs and UDL provide the foundation for effective EL support.

# Think-Pair-Share Protocol
**Literacy Routine for Structured Discussion and Collaborative Learning**
**Scope:** Subject-Common (all ELA programs, all districts)
**Audience:** Curriculum developers creating discussion-based lessons

---

## Overview

**Think-Pair-Share** is a cooperative learning strategy that promotes student engagement, academic discourse, and processing time. Students individually think about a question or prompt, discuss their thoughts with a partner, and then share with the larger group.

**Core Principle:** Providing think time and partner discussion before whole-class sharing increases participation, deepens thinking, and supports emergent bilinguals.

**Literacy Routine Type:** Collaborative (speaking and listening)

---

## Purpose and Benefits

### Why Use Think-Pair-Share?

**For All Students:**
- Increases participation (every student engages, not just volunteers)
- Provides processing time before speaking
- Reduces anxiety about speaking in front of whole class
- Develops listening and speaking skills
- Builds on peers' ideas

**For Emergent Bilinguals:**
- Rehearsal time with partner builds confidence
- Lower-stakes environment for language practice
- Peer support for vocabulary and sentence structure
- Oral language practice before writing
- Think time reduces language processing demands

**For Teachers:**
- Formative assessment opportunity (listen to pairs)
- More students accountable for thinking
- Encourages quieter students to participate
- Builds classroom community

---

## Three-Step Structure

### Step 1: THINK (Individual Processing)

**Purpose:** Students independently process the question or prompt

**Process:**
1. Teacher poses question or prompt
2. Students think silently (no talking)
3. Students may jot notes, annotate, or organize thoughts
4. Typical duration: 30 seconds to 2 minutes (depends on complexity)

**Teacher Actions:**
- Clearly state the question/prompt
- Provide adequate wait time (resist urge to call on first hand)
- Monitor for understanding
- Provide sentence frames if needed

**Student Actions:**
- Think about response
- Organize ideas mentally or on paper
- Prepare to share with partner

---

### Step 2: PAIR (Partner Discussion)

**Purpose:** Students discuss ideas with a partner

**Process:**
1. Students turn to designated partner
2. Partner A shares first (30-60 seconds)
3. Partner B listens and responds (30-60 seconds)
4. Partners may discuss further, build on ideas
5. Typical duration: 1-3 minutes total

**Teacher Actions:**
- Designate partners (or pre-assign pairs)
- Set clear time expectations
- Provide discussion prompts or sentence frames
- Circulate and listen (formative assessment)
- Give time warnings ("30 seconds left")

**Student Actions:**
- Share thinking with partner
- Listen actively to partner
- Ask clarifying questions
- Build on partner's ideas

---

### Step 3: SHARE (Whole-Class Discussion)

**Purpose:** Selected pairs share ideas with whole class

**Process:**
1. Teacher calls on several pairs to share
2. Students report what they or their partner said
3. Class builds collective understanding
4. Teacher synthesizes or connects ideas
5. Typical duration: 3-5 minutes

**Teacher Actions:**
- Call on mix of volunteers and non-volunteers
- Ask students to share partner's idea (not just own)
- Connect ideas across pairs
- Highlight strong reasoning or evidence
- Record key ideas visibly (chart, board)

**Student Actions:**
- Share own or partner's thinking
- Listen to other pairs
- Build on previous shares
- Ask questions for clarification

3. **Pair:** Discuss with partner
4. **Share:** Whole-class sharing

**When to Use:**
- More complex questions requiring organization
- To support students who process better through writing

**When to Use:**
- Building consensus or comparing perspectives
- More in-depth discussion needed
- Collaborative problem-solving

---

### Think-Ink-Pair-Share

**Modification:** Students annotate text before pairing

**Structure:**
1. **Think:** Read and think about text

2. **Pair:** Partner A speaks 1 minute (B listens), then switch
3. **Share:** Whole-class

**When to Use:**
- Ensuring both partners speak equally
- Teaching turn-taking explicitly
- Fast-paced review or brainstorming

---

## Question Types for Think-Pair-Share

### Comprehension Questions (DOK 1-2)

**Examples:**
- "What happened in this chapter?"
- "Who is the main character?"
- "What is the setting of this story?"
- "What does the word 'exhausted' mean in this sentence?"

**Purpose:** Check basic understanding before deeper work

---

### Inference Questions (DOK 2-3)

**Examples:**
- "Why did the character make that choice?"
- "What can you infer about the character's feelings?"
- "What do you think will happen next? Why?"
- "How does the setting affect the plot?"

**Purpose:** Develop inferential thinking with text evidence

---

### Analysis Questions (DOK 3)

**Examples:**
- "How does the author create suspense in this passage?"
- "What is the theme of this text? What evidence supports that?"
- "Compare these two characters' motivations."
- "How does the text structure help you understand the main idea?"

**Purpose:** Analyze author's craft, structure, and deeper meaning

---

### Connection Questions (DOK 2-3)

**Examples:**
- "How does this text connect to [another text we read]?"
- "What does this remind you of from your own life?"
- "How is this similar to/different from [topic]?"

**Purpose:** Build connections and personal engagement

---

### Opinion/Argument Questions (DOK 3-4)

**Examples:**
- "Do you agree with the character's decision? Why or why not?"
- "Which text do you think makes a stronger argument?"
- "What is your opinion on [issue from text]? Support with evidence."

## Scaffolding for Emergent Bilinguals

### Universal Scaffolds

**Sentence Frames (by proficiency level):**

**Emerging:**
- "I think ___."
- "I notice ___."
- "My answer is ___."
- "I agree/disagree."

**Expanding:**
- "I think ___ because ___."
- "My idea is ___. The text says ___."
- "I agree with ___ because ___."
- "Another idea is ___."

**Bridging:**
- "Building on what ___ said, ___."

**See Also:** `/universal/frameworks/sentence-frames-library.md`

---

### Strategic Pairing

**Homogeneous Pairing (same proficiency level):**
- **Pros:** Students speak at similar pace, less intimidating
- **Cons:** No language modeling from more proficient peer

**Heterogeneous Pairing (mixed proficiency):**
- **Pros:** Language modeling, peer support
- **Cons:** May be intimidating for emerging EBs
- **Tip:** Pair emerging with expanding (not emerging with bridging - too big a gap)

**Native Language Pairing:**
- **Pros:** Students can clarify in native language, then use English
- **Cons:** May rely too heavily on native language
- **Tip:** Encourage code-switching (clarify in L1, respond in English)

---

### Additional EB Supports

**Visual Supports:**
- Anchor charts with sentence frames
- Topic-related images or diagrams
- Vocabulary word walls
- Previous student responses displayed

**Processing Time:**
- Extend Think time for EBs (language processing takes longer)
- Allow note-taking during Think time
- Provide written prompt visible (not just oral)

**Modeling:**
- Teacher models Think-Pair-Share with student first
- Show what good partner discussion looks like
- Demonstrate sentence frames in use

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### Introducing Think-Pair-Share

**First Time (Explicit Teaching):**

1. **Explain the Structure**
   - "We're learning a discussion strategy called Think-Pair-Share"
   - "It has three steps: Think alone, talk with a Partner, Share with class"

2. **Model Each Step**
   - Think aloud (show silent thinking)
   - Model partner discussion with volunteer student
   - Show how to share with class ("My partner said...")

3. **Provide Visual Anchor Chart**
   - Three-column chart: Think | Pair | Share
   - Icons or images for each step
   - Sentence frames listed

4. **Practice with Simple Question**
   - Low-stakes question (favorite book, what you ate for lunch)
   - Focus on process, not complex content

5. **Debrief the Process**
   - "What was helpful about Think-Pair-Share?"
   - "What made it easier to share your ideas?"

---

### Ongoing Use

**Frequency:**
- Use multiple times per lesson
- Most effective for key questions, not every question
- Balance with other discussion protocols

**Duration:**
- Total: 4-7 minutes per cycle
- Think: 30 sec - 2 min
- Pair: 1-3 min
- Share: 2-3 min

**Signals:**
- Use consistent language: "Think-Pair-Share time"
- Non-verbal signal to transition (chime, timer)
- Visual timer for think time

---

### Partner Management

**Assigning Partners:**

**Option 1: Shoulder Partner/Face Partner**
- Students have designated "shoulder partner" (person next to them)
- And "face partner" (person across from them)
- Alternate which partner type is used

**Option 2: Clock Partners**
- Students have pre-assigned partners for each "hour" (12, 3, 6, 9 o'clock)
- Teacher calls out which partner to use
- Ensures variety throughout week

**Option 3: Random Partners**
- Draw sticks/cards to pair students
- Good for building community
- Less efficient (time to find partner)

**Option 4: Strategic Pairs (Teacher-Assigned)**
- Mix proficiency levels
- Balance personalities
- Consider language needs
- Rotate monthly

**Best Practice:** Use combination (strategic for complex tasks, random for low-stakes)

---

## Common Mistakes and Fixes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Insufficient Think Time

**Problem:** Teacher asks question and immediately says "Turn to your partner"
- Students haven't processed the question
- Only fast processors benefit

**Fix:** Provide at least 30 seconds of silent think time
- Use timer visible to students
- Explicitly say "No talking yet, just thinking"
- Observe for readiness cues before moving to Pair

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Only Calling on Volunteers in Share

**Problem:** Same students always share (defeats purpose of equity)

**Fix:** Mix of volunteer and non-volunteer shares
- "I'd like to hear from someone who hasn't shared today"
- "Tell us what YOUR PARTNER said" (less pressure)
- Use equity sticks/cards to randomly select

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Sentence Frames for EBs

**Problem:** EBs struggle to formulate academic language responses

**Fix:** Always provide sentence frames
- Display visibly
- Model their use
- Gradually release as students internalize

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: One Partner Dominates

**Problem:** One student talks entire time, other doesn't speak

**Fix:** Structure turn-taking explicitly
- "Partner A, you have 30 seconds. Partner B, listen. Then switch."
- Use timer for each turn
- Teach active listening skills (eye contact, nodding, asking follow-up)

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Question Too Simple or Too Complex

**Problem:**
- Too simple: No real thinking needed ("What color is the sky?")
- Too complex: Can't answer in 1-2 minutes

**Fix:** Match question complexity to DOK level and available time
- Comprehension questions: Quick Think-Pair-Share
- Analysis questions: May need Think-WRITE-Pair-Share

---

### ❌ Mistake 6: Not Monitoring Pairs

**Problem:** Teacher doesn't circulate during Pair time
- Miss formative assessment opportunity
- Can't identify misconceptions
- Off-task pairs not redirected

**Fix:** Actively circulate and listen
- Take notes on strong ideas to highlight in Share
- Identify misconceptions to address
- Provide just-in-time support to struggling pairs

---

## Assessment Opportunities

### Formative Assessment During Think-Pair-Share

**Observe During THINK:**
- Are students engaged? (looking at text, jotting notes)
- Do they seem confused? (need clarification)

**Listen During PAIR:**
- Are both partners participating?
- What level of understanding do they demonstrate?
- What misconceptions emerge?
- What strong ideas should be shared with class?

**Note During SHARE:**
- Track who participates
- Document strong responses
- Identify patterns in understanding

---

### Using Think-Pair-Share Data

**Immediate Adjustments:**
- If many pairs confused → reteach concept before moving on
- If understanding solid → move to next level of complexity
- If only surface-level responses → ask follow-up questions

**Instructional Planning:**
- Note concepts that need reteaching
- Identify students who need additional support
- Celebrate strong thinking publicly

---

## Think-Pair-Share Across Grade Levels

### K-2 Adaptations

**Structure:**
- Shorter think time (15-30 seconds)
- More modeling and support
- Simple questions
- Oral responses (not written)

**Tips:**
- Teach partner behaviors explicitly (eyes, ears, voice)
- Use visual cues (turn to partner icon)
- Keep pair time short (30-60 seconds)

**Example Question (K):**
"What was your favorite part of the story?"

---

### 3-5 Adaptations

**Structure:**
- Standard think time (30 sec - 1 min)
- May add writing component
- More complex questions
- Teach reporting partner's idea

**Tips:**
- Introduce Think-Write-Pair-Share
- Emphasize building on partner's ideas
- Use sentence frames consistently

**Example Question (Grade 4):**
"What is the main idea of this article? What details support it?"

---

### 6-8 Adaptations

**Structure:**
- Extended think time for complex questions (1-2 min)
- Expect written notes
- Analysis and argumentation questions
- Students facilitate discussions

**Tips:**
- Use Think-Pair-Square for more in-depth discussion
- Expect citation of text evidence
- Teach respectful disagreement
- May extend to Think-Pair-Share-Write

**Example Question (Grade 8):**
"How does the author use symbolism to develop the theme? Cite specific examples."

---

## Integration with Other Literacy Routines

### Think-Pair-Share + Close Reading

**Use Think-Pair-Share throughout Close Reading:**
- **After First Read:** "What is this text about?"
- **After Second Read:** "How does the author create [effect]?"
- **After Third Read:** "What is the theme?"

**See Also:** `/subjects/ela/common/literacy-routines/close-reading-protocol.md`

---

### Think-Pair-Share + Annotation

**Combine:**
1. Students annotate text (Think + Ink)
2. Pairs compare annotations
3. Share findings with class

**See Also:** `/subjects/ela/common/literacy-routines/annotation-protocol.md`

---

### Think-Pair-Share + Turn and Talk

**Difference:**
- **Think-Pair-Share:** Structured three steps with whole-class share
- **Turn and Talk:** Quick partner discussion (no formal think or whole-class share)

**When to Use Each:**
- Think-Pair-Share: Key questions, want whole-class discussion
- Turn and Talk: Quick processing, no need for whole-class sharing

**See Also:** `/subjects/ela/common/literacy-routines/turn-and-talk.md`

---

## Time Management

### Full Think-Pair-Share (6-7 minutes)

**Breakdown:**
- Think: 1 minute
- Pair: 2-3 minutes
- Share: 3 minutes

**When to Use:** Important questions, need depth

---

### Quick Think-Pair-Share (3-4 minutes)

**Breakdown:**
- Think: 30 seconds
- Pair: 1-2 minutes
- Share: 1-2 minutes

**When to Use:** Checking understanding, simpler questions

---

### Think-Pair Only (2-3 minutes)

**Variation:** Skip whole-class share

**When to Use:**
- Processing time before moving on
- Formative assessment by circulating
- Building toward writing (partner discussion scaffolds)

**Remember:** Think-Pair-Share is deceptively simple but incredibly powerful. The magic is in the structure—providing think time, partner rehearsal, and multiple entry points for participation. When used consistently, it becomes a classroom norm that increases equity, deepens thinking, and builds community. The key is adequate wait time and holding students accountable for all three steps.

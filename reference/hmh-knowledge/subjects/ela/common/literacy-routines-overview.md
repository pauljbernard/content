# Literacy Routines Overview
**Instructional Routines for ELA**
**Scope:** All ELA programs (cross-district)
**Audience:** Curriculum developers creating ELA content

---

## Overview

**Literacy Routines** are structured instructional protocols that support reading, writing, speaking, and listening development. Like MLRs in mathematics, literacy routines provide consistent structures that build language and literacy skills.

**Core Principle:** Consistent, research-based routines develop literacy competencies more effectively than varied, ad-hoc instruction.

## The 6 Core Literacy Routines

### Routine 1: Close Reading Protocol
**Purpose:** Deep comprehension through multiple readings
**Use:** Complex texts requiring analysis

**Structure:**
- **Read 1:** Gist (What's it about?)
- **Read 2:** Key details (What matters?)
- **Read 3:** Author's craft (How does it work?)
- **Read 4:** Application (What does it mean?)

**Frequency:** 2-3 times per week
**Time:** 15-25 minutes

---

### Routine 2: Think-Pair-Share
**Purpose:** Build discussion skills and process thinking
**Use:** Before, during, or after reading

**Structure:**
- **Think:** Individual reflection (2 min)
- **Pair:** Share with partner (3-4 min)
- **Share:** Whole-class discussion (5 min)

**Frequency:** Daily
**Time:** 10-15 minutes

---

### Routine 3: Turn and Talk
**Purpose:** Quick partner discussion to process ideas
**Use:** During read-alouds, mini-lessons, or writing instruction

**Structure:**
- **Prompt:** Teacher poses question
- **Turn:** Face partner quickly
- **Talk:** 1-2 minutes of discussion
- **Share:** Selected pairs share with class

**Frequency:** Multiple times per lesson
**Time:** 2-3 minutes per use

---

### Routine 4: Annotation Protocol
**Purpose:** Active reading and note-making
**Use:** During independent or guided reading

**Structure:**
- **Mark:** Underline key ideas
- **Question:** Write questions in margins
- **Connect:** Note connections to other texts or experiences
- **Reflect:** Summary notes

**Frequency:** 2-3 times per week
**Time:** Built into reading time

---

### Routine 5: Writing Process Routine
**Purpose:** Consistent approach to writing tasks
**Use:** All writing assignments

**Structure:**
- **Prewrite:** Planning and organizing
- **Draft:** Getting ideas down
- **Revise:** Improving content and organization
- **Edit:** Correcting conventions
- **Publish:** Sharing final product

**Frequency:** Ongoing throughout writing units
**Time:** Multiple lessons

---

### Routine 6: Vocabulary Routine (Word Study)
**Purpose:** Deep word learning beyond definitions
**Use:** New vocabulary instruction

**Structure:**
- **Introduce:** Context and definition
- **Explore:** Word parts, synonyms, antonyms
- **Apply:** Use in sentences and discussions
- **Revisit:** Spaced practice over time

**Frequency:** 2-3 times per week
**Time:** 10-15 minutes

## Comparison to Mathematics MLRs

| Aspect | Math (MLR) | ELA (Literacy Routines) |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Develop mathematical language | Develop literacy skills |
| **Routines** | 8 routines (MLR1-8) | 6 core routines |
| **Frequency** | Varies by routine | Varies by routine |
| **Structure** | Highly structured | Structured but flexible |
| **Focus** | Problem-solving context | Text-based context |

**Similarity:** Both provide consistent, research-based protocols that build over time.

---

## Integration with Other ELA Components

### Literacy Routines + Genre Study
- Close Reading with mentor texts
- Writing Process for genre-specific pieces
- Annotation during genre studies

- Vocabulary Routine for word patterns
- Annotation for word recognition strategies

### Literacy Routines + Independent Reading
- Annotation Protocol during reading
- Think-Pair-Share for book discussions

---

## Texas ELA Alignment

### TEKS ELA Connection:
Literacy routines support multiple TEKS standards:
- Reading comprehension strategies
- Author's purpose and craft
- Discussion and collaboration
- Writing process
- Vocabulary development

### ELPS Connection:
Routines support all four domains:
- **Listening:** Turn and Talk, Think-Pair-Share
- **Speaking:** All discussion routines
- **Reading:** Close Reading, Annotation
- **Writing:** Writing Process Routine

**Note:** Same ELPS standards as math (Texas district-wide), but applied to ELA context.

---

## Emergent Bilingual Support

### Scaffolds for Literacy Routines:

**Emerging Level:**
- Sentence frames for Turn and Talk
- Visual annotation symbols
- Word banks for vocabulary routine
- Allow drawing in prewriting

**Expanding Level:**
- Discussion frames for Think-Pair-Share
- Partial annotation models
- Sentence starters for writing
- Vocabulary graphic organizers

**Bridging Level:**
- Optional frames
- Independent annotation
- Full writing process
- Academic vocabulary focus

**Note:** EB scaffolding principles same as math (universal framework), applied to literacy context.

## Knowledge Reuse Examples

### What ELA Reuses from Universal/Districts:

✅ **DOK Framework** - Same DOK 1-4 levels (universal)
✅ **UDL Principles** - Same accessibility principles (universal)
✅ **EB Scaffolding Principles** - Same strategies (universal frameworks)
✅ **ELPS Standards** - Same language standards for Texas (Texas district)
✅ **IPACC Requirements** - Same content restrictions for Texas (Texas district)
✅ **Assessment Guidelines** - Item types, scoring, parity, validation (universal)
✅ **Alt Text Principles** - Same accessibility for images (universal)

### What ELA Needs That's ELA-Specific:

🔧 **Literacy Routines** - This file (ELA subject-common)
🔧 **TEKS ELA Standards** - Different from TEKS Math (Texas ELA)
🔧 **Genre-Specific Guidance** - Narrative, informational, argumentative
🔧 **Reading Comprehension Strategies** - Text-specific approaches
🔧 **Writing Instruction Frameworks** - Process and craft

---

**Remember:** Literacy routines are the ELA equivalent of MLRs - consistent, research-based structures that build skills over time. Like MLRs, they integrate with language support (ELPS), accessibility (UDL), and assessment practices (DOK). The difference is context: MLRs focus on mathematical language, literacy routines focus on reading, writing, and discussion.

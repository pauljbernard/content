# Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Principles Guide
**Source:** UDL Guidelines (3).docx
**Website:** https://udlguidelines.cast.org/
**Required in SYL:** Minimum 2 supports per lesson, non-repeating principles

---

## Overview

Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is an educational framework guiding development of flexible learning to support learners with learning differences. For Into Math TX, UDL supports not only enhance mathematical content but provide teachers with strategies to maintain rigor while increasing accessibility.

**Core Philosophy:** Design for variability from the start, not as an afterthought.

---

## The 3 UDL Principles

### 1. Engagement (The "WHY" of Learning)
### 2. Representation (The "WHAT" of Learning)
### 3. Action & Expression (The "HOW" of Learning)

---

## Required Implementation in Into Math TX

### Spark Your Learning (SYL) - REQUIRED
**Minimum:** 1 UDL support per SYL
**Location:** Teacher Edition, after EB scaffolds
**Format:**
```
UDL: [Principle Name]
[Task-specific support strategy]
```

### Lesson-Wide - REQUIRED
**Minimum:** 2 UDL supports total per lesson
**Constraint:** Do NOT repeat a principle within same lesson
**Example:** If SYL uses Engagement, subsequent support must use Representation or Action & Expression

### Specificity Requirement
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Do NOT copy/paste generic examples. Make support specific to the task and mathematical content.

---

## PRINCIPLE 1: Engagement

**The "WHY" of Learning**

**Purpose:** Recruit students' interest, sustain effort, and help them self-regulate

### Three Components:

#### 1.1 Recruiting Interest
**Goal:** Spark excitement and curiosity

**Strategies:**
- Individual choice (multiple entry points)
- Relevance, value, authenticity of content
- Minimize threats and distractions to learning
- Cultural and community connections

**Example (Generic - DON'T USE):**
"Allow students to work together."

**Example (Specific - DO USE):**
"Relate the concept of remainders to situations in the community. Teacher: *How might dividing resources in a family or community event lead to remainders? How are such situations typically handled at your family or community events?*"

#### 1.2 Sustaining Effort and Persistence
**Goal:** Tackle challenges with focus and determination

**Strategies:**
- Stress importance of goals and objectives
- Vary demands and resources to optimize challenge
- Foster collaboration and community with students
- Increase mastery-oriented feedback

**Example (Specific):**
"Support students in their understanding of [insert mathematical content] by partnering them with a student who has mastered the concept. [Insert task-specific support.]"

#### 1.3 Self-Regulation
**Goal:** Harness the power of emotions and motivation in learning

**Strategies:**
- Promote expectations and beliefs that encourage motivation
- Facilitate personal coping skills and strategies
- Develop self-assessment and reflection opportunities

**Example (Specific):**
"Before having students discuss the Turn and Talk, remind them of the Learning Goal and how it is related to the task just completed."

---

### Engagement: Sample Supports by Type

**Partner/Collaboration:**
"Use the sentence frame to guide students to listen to their partner and reflect on their learning. Teacher: *What I heard you share was___. When you shared ___ it made me wonder/realize___. I learned from my partner that___. Next time I see a problem like this I might___.*"

**Positive Reinforcement:**
"Provide positive reinforcement as students work with partners. Teacher: *Wow, I really like how you calmly explained your confusion to your partner. Keep working together to see if you can solve this!*"

**Reflection:**
"Prompt students to reflect on their understanding of remainders and how it can apply outside of the classroom. Teacher: *Let's think about a time we had something left over after sharing, like pieces of a chocolate bar after everyone gets an equal piece. What could we do with the small piece that's left?*"

**Goal Connection:**
"Encourage students to reflect on their learning and identify what they have learned.

**Possible sentence frames for this activity:**
- *I used to think ___, now I know ___ because ___.*
- *Whenever I have a problem with a remainder, I learned to ask myself ___.*"

**Community/Cultural Connection:**
"Facilitate discussions among students about diverse learning and mathematical abilities. Teacher: *Share how you thought about the division problem and listen to how your partner approached it. What did you learn from each other?*"

---

## PRINCIPLE 2: Representation

**The "WHAT" of Learning**

**Purpose:** Provide multiple means of perceiving, understanding, and making sense of information

### Three Components:

#### 2.1 Perception
**Goal:** Interact with flexible content that doesn't depend on single sense

**Strategies:**
- Offer ways of customizing content
- Offer alternatives for auditory information
- Offer alternatives for visual information

**Example (Specific):**
"To support students with explaining their thinking around unit fractions, provide them with fraction strips to work with."

#### 2.2 Language and Symbols
**Goal:** Communicate through languages that create shared understanding

**Strategies:**
- Clarify vocabulary and symbols
- Clarify syntax and structure
- Support decoding of text, mathematical notation, symbols
- Promote understanding across languages
- Illustrate through multiple media

**Example (Specific):**
"Remind students that they can use the Three Reads strategy for any word problem."

#### 2.3 Comprehension
**Goal:** Construct meaning and generate new understandings

**Strategies:**
- Activate or supply background knowledge
- Highlight patterns, critical features, big ideas, relationships
- Guide information processing and visualization
- Maximize transfer and generalization

**Example (Specific):**
"Guide students to make connection with [math content] and what has been learned previously. Teacher: *How is telling time to the quarter hour similar to fractional parts of a circle?*"

---

### Representation: Sample Supports by Type

**Visual/Manipulative:**
"Provide students with visuals like charts, pictures, movies, audio clips, and things for students to touch and manipulate."

**Structure Reminders:**
"Point out text structure, sentence structure, or math formulas if they are important for learning."

**Simplify Directions:**
"Read through the word problem with the students. Rephrase the problem using only the important information required for solving."

**Prior Knowledge:**
"Remind students what they already know about the content. *Remember, _____ means _____.*"

**Modeling/Think Aloud:**
"Model the process of working through the problem with students. Say aloud each step to solving. Teacher: *When I see a division problem, I first think about how many groups I can make. If there are items leftover, that's my remainder. How might these leftovers be used or interpreted in real life?*"

**Scaffolds & Resources:**
"Remind students to use the resources around them to solve. Point to the [word wall, anchor chart, example on the board] and allow students to access the information when needed."

**Transfer & Connection:**
"Help students see how they can use the new information in other classes, units, or settings."

---

## PRINCIPLE 3: Action & Expression

**The "HOW" of Learning**

**Purpose:** Provide multiple means for students to demonstrate what they know

### Three Components:

#### 3.1 Physical Action
**Goal:** Vary methods for response and navigation

**Strategies:**
- Vary the methods for response and navigation
- Optimize access to tools and assistive technologies

**Example (Specific):**
"Allow students to share their thinking by writing, speaking, drawing, using manipulatives, or acting out the problem."

#### 3.2 Expression and Communication
**Goal:** Use multiple tools and media for expression

**Strategies:**
- Use multiple media for communication
- Use multiple tools for construction and composition
- Build fluencies with graduated levels of support

**Example (Specific):**
"Encourage students to show their work on a whiteboard, using paper and pencil, or on their device."

#### 3.3 Executive Functions
**Goal:** Guide goal setting, planning, strategy development, monitoring

**Strategies:**
- Guide appropriate goal setting
- Support planning and strategy development
- Facilitate managing information and resources
- Enhance capacity for monitoring progress

**Example (Specific):**
"Support students with completing the multistep problem in the correct order, work with them to take numbered notes outlining the steps used for solving."

---

### Action & Expression: Sample Supports by Type

**Response Options:**
"Give students choices about how they will respond. Give students the option to composing with writing, typing, physically manipulating objects, drawing, etc."

**Tool Flexibility:**
"Allow students to complete assignments using different tools like paper, whiteboards, devices, etc."

**Organization Support:**
"Give students tips on how to stay organized while working."

**Reflection & Monitoring:**
"Have students reflect on what they have learned and write down any questions they still have and identify what strategies helped them to learn the new material.

*The strategy _____ helped me to understand ___. I still have questions about ___.*"

**Math-Specific Strategies:**
"Help students count by 10s by pointing out the pattern that 10, 20, 30, 40 etc. is the same as counting 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. with a zero coming after the number in the tens place value."

**General Problem-Solving:**
"To support students with solving the problem, encourage them to draw a diagram to visualize the information in the problem."

**Emotional Regulation:**
"When you see students getting frustrated with their partner work, provide them with a sentence frame to better express their frustrations with their partner.

*I am really frustrated with _____, because _____. Can you please help me better understand this by _____.*"

**Classroom Management:**
"Support students with the transition into partner work, by allowing them 1 minute to organize their materials together before getting to work."

## Key Principles for Implementation

### 1. Task-Specific, Not Generic
❌ "Allow students to work together."
✅ "Support students in their understanding of composing shapes by partnering them with a student who has mastered the concept. Encourage partners to use manipulatives to demonstrate different ways to make the house shape."

### 2. Maintain Mathematical Rigor
UDL is NOT about making math easier. It's about making the same rigorous math accessible through multiple pathways.

### 3. Do NOT Repeat Principles in Same Lesson
**Example:**
- SYL: UDL Engagement
- Task 2: UDL Representation ✅
- Task 3: UDL Engagement ❌ (already used)

### 4. Align with Mathematical Content
The UDL support should specifically address the mathematics being learned in that task.

### 5. Support Both Access and Challenge
- Provide entry points for students who struggle
- Extend opportunities for students ready for more

---

## Common Implementation Errors

### ❌ Copy-Paste Generic Examples
**Problem:** Using exact wording from guidelines without customization
**Solution:** Adapt to specific mathematical content and task

### ❌ Repeating Principles
**Problem:** Using same principle (e.g., Engagement) in SYL and Quick Check
**Solution:** Track which principles used, ensure variety

### ❌ Lowering Rigor
**Problem:** Making problems easier instead of more accessible
**Solution:** Maintain grade-level expectations, vary access points

### ❌ Vague Support
**Problem:** "Use visuals" or "Allow choice" without specifics
**Solution:** Specify WHICH visuals, WHAT choices, HOW to implement

### ❌ Ignoring Content Alignment
**Problem:** Generic support unrelated to mathematical concept
**Solution:** Tie support directly to the mathematics being learned

## UDL + Other Supports Integration

UDL works synergistically with other supports:

**UDL + MLR:**
- MLR provides structured language routine
- UDL suggests how to make that routine accessible
- Example: MLR Three Reads + UDL Representation (provide visual timeline)

**UDL + EB Scaffolding:**
- EB scaffolds provide language levels
- UDL suggests how students can express understanding
- Example: EB sentence frames + UDL Action & Expression (multiple response options)

**UDL + Common Error:**
- Common Error identifies misconception
- UDL suggests how to address it accessibly
- Example: Common Error (confusing perimeter/area) + UDL Representation (color-code boundaries vs. interior)

## Quick Reference: Principle Selection

| Task Demands | Best UDL Principle | Sample Support |
|---|---|---|
| Students seem disengaged | **Engagement** | Connect to community, offer choice, partner work |
| Complex vocabulary or symbols | **Representation** | Visual models, clarify language, prior knowledge |
| Students struggle to show thinking | **Action & Expression** | Multiple response options, organizational tools, reflection |
| Diverse entry points needed | **Representation** | Provide manipulatives, visuals, examples |
| Motivation/confidence low | **Engagement** | Positive reinforcement, goal connection, celebration |
| Explaining/justifying required | **Action & Expression** | Sentence frames, think-aloud model, peer teaching |

---

## Sample UDL Supports by Grade Band

### K-2 (Composing Shapes):

**Engagement:**
"Connect the task to students' experiences. Teacher: *Think about houses you see in your neighborhood. What shapes do you notice? Today we'll compose shapes to make our own houses.*"

**Representation:**
"Provide variety of triangles and squares in different sizes and colors. Model one example of composing shapes, then encourage students to create their own unique house designs."

**Action & Expression:**
"Allow students to show their house shape by building with manipulatives, drawing their design, or arranging pre-cut shapes on paper. Encourage them to share their thinking using words, gestures, or pointing."

---

### 3-5 (Division with Remainders):

**Engagement:**
"Present a real-world scenario: *Our class has 46 cookies to share equally among 7 tables. How many cookies does each table get? What do we do with the extras?* Discuss fair sharing in their own lives."

**Representation:**
"Model division with remainders using three representations: counters grouped on table, array drawing on board, and number line hops. Connect all three representations to show they represent the same mathematical idea."

**Action & Expression:**
"Students can solve using manipulatives, drawing, or repeated subtraction on paper. Encourage them to explain their strategy in writing, orally to a partner, or by demonstrating with materials."

---

### 6-8 (Linear Equations):

**Engagement:**
"Pose a challenge: *Can you find three different ways to solve this equation? Which way is most efficient? Convince your partner.* Celebrate multiple solution strategies."

**Representation:**
"Provide balance scale visual, algebra tiles, and symbolic notation. Show how all three represent the same equation. Students choose which representation helps them make sense of solving process."

**Action & Expression:**
"Students solve using method of choice (tiles, symbolic, visual), then create a step-by-step guide for others explaining their chosen method. Can present as poster, digital slideshow, or written explanation."

---

**Remember:** UDL is about designing for variability from the start. Every learner benefits when there are multiple pathways to engagement, representation, and action/expression.

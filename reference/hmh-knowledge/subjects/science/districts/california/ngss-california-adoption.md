# NGSS California Adoption Guide
**Next Generation Science Standards - California Implementation**
**Source:** California Department of Education
**Applies To:** K-8 Science (California only)

---

## Overview

**California uses NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards)** directly as its science content standards, adopted in 2013. All instructional materials must explicitly align to NGSS Performance Expectations and integrate the California Science Framework guidance.

**Core Principle:** Three-dimensional learning (Science Practices + Disciplinary Core Ideas + Crosscutting Concepts) with strong emphasis on equity, ELD integration, and phenomena-based instruction.

---

## California Science Standards

### NGSS Adoption:

**California Adopted:** Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in 2013
**Framework:** California Science Framework (2016) - provides guidance for implementing NGSS
**Performance Expectations:** Same as national NGSS (no California modifications)

**Key Point:** California uses NGSS **exactly as written** - no state-specific modifications to PE codes or content.

---

## NGSS in California vs. Other States

| State | Science Standards | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| **California** | NGSS (adopted directly) | Uses national NGSS PEs exactly |
| **Washington** | NGSS (adopted directly) | Same as California |
| **Texas** | TEKS Science | Different organization, not NGSS |
| **Florida** | NGSSS | NGSS-aligned but state-specific codes |

**Important:** Materials aligned to NGSS work in California AND 19 other NGSS states with minimal modification.

---

## California Science Framework (2016)

### Framework Purpose:

**The California Science Framework** provides guidance for implementing NGSS, including:
- Instructional strategies for three-dimensional learning
- Equity and access for all students
- ELD integration
- Assessment guidance
- Preferred Integrated Model (PIM) for middle school

**Framework Structure:**
- Chapter 1: Vision for CA Science Education
- Chapter 2: Instructional Strategies for NGSS
- Chapter 3: Ensuring Success for All Students (ELD, Special Ed, GATE)
- Chapters 4-7: Grade band guidance (K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12)
- Chapter 8: Curriculum, Instruction, Assessment

---

## Three-Dimensional Learning in California

### The Three Dimensions:

**California follows NGSS three-dimensional model exactly:**

**Dimension 1: Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs)**
- 8 practices students engage in
- Same as national NGSS (see `/subjects/science/common/ngss-alignment-guide.md`)

**Dimension 2: Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs)**
- Core content in physical, life, Earth/space sciences
- Same as national NGSS

**Dimension 3: Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs)**
- 7 concepts spanning all domains
- Same as national NGSS

**California Emphasis:** All three dimensions taught together in every lesson (not separately)

**See Also:** `/subjects/science/common/ngss-alignment-guide.md` for complete NGSS structure

---

## California-Specific NGSS Implementation

### What's Different in California:

**1. Preferred Integrated Model (PIM) for Middle School**

**California Recommends:**
- Grades 6-8: Integrated science (not separate biology, chemistry, physics)
- Mix physical, life, and Earth/space science each year
- Reflects how science works in real world

**Example Grade 6 PIM:**
```
Module 1: Energy in Earth Systems (ESS + PS)
Module 2: Structure and Function in Living Things (LS + PS)
Module 3: Matter and Energy in Organisms (LS + PS)
Module 4: Weather and Climate (ESS + PS)
```

**Note:** California allows disciplinary model (separate courses) but PIM is preferred.

---

**2. Strong Equity Focus**

**California Framework Emphasizes:**
- All students can learn science at high levels
- Asset-based approach (build on students' strengths)
- Culturally relevant phenomena
- Multiple entry points for diverse learners
- Universal Design for Learning (UDL)

**Equity Principles:**
- High expectations for all
- Access to grade-level science
- Scaffolds and supports (not watered-down content)
- Opportunities to use home language and culture

---

**3. Phenomena-Based Instruction**

**California Requires:**
- Lessons anchored in observable phenomena
- Real-world events students can see/experience
- Drives questions and investigations
- Makes science relevant

**Example Phenomena:**
```
Grade 3: Why do shadows change throughout the day?
Grade 5: Why do some materials sink and others float?
Grade 8: Why do we see different phases of the Moon?
```

**Non-Example (Not Phenomena-Based):**
```
❌ "Today we're learning about photosynthesis"
✅ "Why do plants need sunlight to grow?" (anchored in observable phenomenon)
```

---

## ELD Integration for NGSS

### California ELD Standards:

**California has ELD (English Language Development) Standards** that integrate with NGSS.

**ELD Organization:**
- Part I: Interacting in Meaningful Ways (collaborative, interpretive, productive)
- Part II: Learning About How English Works (text types, language structures)

**Key ELD Standards for Science:**

**ELD.PI.5.1** - Engage in conversational exchanges (science discussions)
**ELD.PI.5.6** - Explain ideas and phenomena with moderate support
**ELD.PI.5.11** - Justify opinions or persuade with evidence
**ELD.PII.5.1** - Understand text organization (science texts)

**Grades 6-8:** Integrated science (not separate courses)

**Why PIM?**
- Reflects real-world science (scientists don't work in silos)
- Makes connections across disciplines
- More engaging for students
- Aligns with NGSS vision

**Example PIM Structure:**

**Grade 6:**
- Energy in Earth Systems (ESS + PS)
- Structure and Function in Living Things (LS + PS)
- Matter and Energy in Organisms (LS + PS)
- Weather and Climate (ESS + PS + LS)

**Grade 7:**
- Chemical Reactions (PS)
- Cells and Body Systems (LS)
- Ecosystems (LS + ESS)
- Earth's Systems (ESS + PS)

**Grade 8:**
- Forces and Motion (PS)
- Heredity and Genetics (LS)
- Natural Selection and Adaptation (LS)
- Space Systems and History of Earth (ESS + PS)

**Note:** Disciplinary model (separate biology, chemistry, physics) is allowed but PIM is strongly preferred.

## Implementation Guidance

### Lesson Planning for California NGSS:

**Step 1: Identify Performance Expectation**
- Which PE(s) will this lesson address?
- What are the SEP, DCI, and CCC?

**Step 2: Choose Phenomenon**
- What observable phenomenon anchors this lesson?
- Is it relevant to students' lives?
- Does it generate authentic questions?

**Step 3: Plan Three-Dimensional Instruction**
- How will students USE practices (SEP)?
- How will they build understanding of core ideas (DCI)?
- Which crosscutting concept(s) provide lens (CCC)?
- Are all three integrated (not taught separately)?

**Step 4: Integrate ELD**
- Which ELD standards connect?
- What language demands exist (vocabulary, syntax, discourse)?
- What scaffolds needed (sentence frames, visuals, etc.)?

**Step 5: Design Assessment**
- How will students demonstrate three-dimensional learning?
- Multiple modalities? (written, oral, visual, model)
- Accessible to ELs and diverse learners?

**Step 6: Validate Alignment**
- Does lesson fully address PE?
- Are all three dimensions integrated?
- Is phenomenon authentic and engaging?
- Are ELD supports included?
- Does lesson reflect California Framework principles?

---

**Remember:** California uses NGSS directly with no state modifications to Performance Expectations. The California Science Framework provides implementation guidance emphasizing phenomena-based instruction, equity, ELD integration, and the Preferred Integrated Model for middle school. Since NGSS is the national standard, 95% of content guidance is reusable from subject-common NGSS files—only ELD scaffolding and California-specific adoption criteria are unique. When designing for California, ensure phenomena anchor every lesson, all three dimensions are integrated, and ELD supports are robust for the state's diverse learner population.

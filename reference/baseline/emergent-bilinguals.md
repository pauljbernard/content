**Emergent Bilinguals Support Guidelines**

Emergent Bilinguals support is focused on an asset-based approach to
learning. We want to highlight what the students **can do** to show
their understanding of learned content. We are looking to amplify the
mathematical content for students, not simplify it. Language supports
need to be scaffolded based on language proficiency to provide
appropriate assistance to learners while maintaining the rigor of the
task. It is important to note that mathematically challenging components
should not be reduced while providing language supports for Emergent
Bilinguals. Language supports include productive high-level activities
beyond vocabulary learning. All supports need to be designed to help
learners make meaning of the content through collaborating,
interpreting, as well as producing and extending their mathematical
understanding and language.

There will be Emergent Bilinguals support at point of use throughout
each lesson. All the support being authored needs to directly support
the mathematical concept being taught in the task that the support is
located in. The locations of these supports are as follows: 

[Language Objective](#LO)

[Learning Goal](#LG)

[Spark Your Learning](#SYL)

[Spark Your Learning Turn and Talk](#SYLTable)

[Task Turn and Talk](#T1)

[Review Spark Your Learning](#Bookmark1)

[]{#LO .anchor}**Before you Teach - Language Objective:**

The Language Skill/Domain used in the Learning Objective will be used to
drive the provided EB support within the lesson. Whichever domain(s) is
used in the learning objective will determine which type of EB support
is chosen throughout the lesson.

To write the Language Objective, consider the following pieces:

-   Learning Objective of the lesson

-   Process Standard in the lesson

-   Language Skills/Domains for the lesson

Begin writing the Language Objective by reviewing the Learning Objective
to identify the lesson content that the students will be using the
Language Objective to show an understanding of.

Then, use the Process Standard(s) addressed in the lesson to determine
what students are using the domain to do.

Finally, select an appropriate Language Domain (reading, writing,
listening, speaking, viewing, or representing.) If the lesson has more
than one domain, focus on the output domain (speaking, writing, or
representing). The language objective should use a verb that explicitly
tells what domain was selected, such as:

-   Orally...

-   Write...

-   Represent...

**Example 1:**

![](media/image1.png){width="5.308333333333334in"
height="2.639420384951881in"}

**Learning Objective:** Identify and interpret integers using a number
line.

**Process Standard(s):** Reason abstractly and quantitatively; Model
with mathematics

**Language Domain:** Writing

**New Language Objective:** Write to explain how to identify and
interpret integers in a number line using varied and precise vocabulary.

**Example 2:**

![](media/image3.png){width="6.557709973753281in"
height="2.9418602362204727in"}

**Learning Objective:** Represent groups of tens in the range 10-90 with
objects, drawings, and numerals.

**Process Standard(s):** Reason abstractly and quantitatively; Look for
and make use of structure

**Language Domain:** Representing

**New Language Objective:** Show how to use objects, drawings, and
numerals to represent groups of tens from 10-90 connecting the
relationship between the representations.

height="4.478881233595801in"}

**Learning Goal:**  

The teacher notes of the learning goal will have teacher-specific
support for clarifying vocabulary in the I Can Objective. Select one or
two terms for clarification and instruct the teacher on how to clarify
the meaning. Not all words chosen need to be math academic vocabulary.
For any math specific terms, please refer to the definition found in the
[Vocabulary
Tracker](https://hmhco.app.box.com/folder/345185358110?s=7quago5glwe2i4bbccr5aqdt6g7isdbh).

Use the [EB Resources
document](https://hmhco.box.com/s/uya51181y8o42pdwgtk3h7smde2nal4t) as a
toolbox to select a support strategy based on the language domain
selected for the Language Objective. Use the examples in the toolbox as
a guide in authoring new support specific to the content of the task. Do
not copy and paste the examples as is. Be sure to vary the strategies
used from lesson to lesson.

-   **Turn and Talk Emergent Bilinguals Teaching Strategy:**

    -   Select a Strategy from the [EB Resources
        document](https://hmhco.box.com/s/uya51181y8o42pdwgtk3h7smde2nal4t)
        from the Language Domain selected for the Language Objective.
        The domain informs how the students interact with the content.
        For example, if the domain is only speaking, then you need to
        use the strategies for supporting students speaking. In some
        lessons, the domains may be representing/speaking. For those
        lessons, you can use the strategies in both the speaking and the
        representing categories.

    -   Provide teachers with support in understanding the goal of the
        strategy, example scripting and resources can be found in the EB
        Resource spreadsheet.

    -   After the teaching strategy, include the boilerplate: **Use the
        Supporting All Language Learners chart to let students choose
        the language scaffolding that they need.**

**Example:**

***Use the sentence frames and sentence starters to support students'
discussions and written explanations. Encourage Emergent Bilinguals
students to speak in their home language and use their models to support
their explanation. Ask students to write their responses to describe how
to interpret the remainder.***

***Use the Supporting All Language Learners chart to provide language
scaffolding for all proficiency levels.***

\*Avoid telling the students what order they should complete the
speaking, writing, and/or representing. Students may have a preference
in which order they complete the tasks, and we should allow them to
decide if appropriate.

-   []{#SYLTable .anchor}**Turn and Talk Tool Table:**

    -   Use the strategy selected in the Turn and Talk Emergent
        Bilinguals Teaching Strategy box.

    -   Use the [EB Resource
        document](https://hmhco.box.com/s/uya51181y8o42pdwgtk3h7smde2nal4t)
        to find examples and resources for authoring the differentiated
        support based on the Language Domain.

    -   The strategy must be differentiated to represent support for the
        following Language Proficiency Levels:

        -   Pre-Production/Beginning

        -   Intermediate

        -   High Intermediate/Advanced

    -   Select a Strategy from the EB Resources spreadsheet.

    -   Use the [EB Resource
        document](https://hmhco.box.com/s/uya51181y8o42pdwgtk3h7smde2nal4t)
        to find examples and resources for authoring the differentiated
        support.

    -   This support will always be focused on student discussion and
        communicating learning growth.

    -   The example below is not boilerplate. Please use a variety of
        approaches to support discussion.

**Example:**

***Use sentence starters to support students\' discussion.***

***Before I solved the problem by\_\_\_\_\_\_.***

***Now I would solve the problem by\_\_\_\_\_\_.***

[]{#T1 .anchor}**Task or Task Turn and Talk:**  

-   Select a strategy from the [EB Resources
    document](https://hmhco.box.com/s/uya51181y8o42pdwgtk3h7smde2nal4t).

-   The support found in the Tasks can call back to and be linked to the
    previously used strategy in the SYL table if appropriate, but it
    needs to include an example of how to apply the strategy to the
    content of the task.

-   This support will not include a table with proficiency-based
    support, so be sure to provide the teacher with a clear
    understanding of how to support their students. See Example Teaching
    Support in the EB Resources tracker for scripting examples and
    resources.

-   Be sure the support correlates directly with the content of the Task
    or Turn and Talk.

**Example for this Turn and Talk:**

![](media/image8.png){width="2.6780391513560806in"
height="1.932665135608049in"}

***Use sentence frames, sentence starters, and/or banks similar to the
con those from the Emergent Bilinguals Teaching Strategy earlier in the
lesson as tools to support their writing to explain how they interpret
the remainder.***

***The whole number quotient tells \_\_\_\_.***

***The remainder tells \_\_\_\_.***

[]{#Bookmark2 .anchor}**Quick Check:**

-   In the teacher notes include the following boilerplate followed by
    lesson specific information:

***"To measure students' mastery of the language objective, ask them
to\..."***

> Complete the sentence so that it reflects what teachers will be
> measuring based on the domain in the Language Objective. For example,

-   For the writing domain: "\...write and explanation of \[rephrase
    Language Objective\].

-   For the speaking domain: "\...orally explain \[rephrase Language
    Objective\].

-   For the representing domain: "\...use \[manipulatives, visual
    models, equations, etc.\] to show \[rephrase Language Objective\].

**Example in Teacher Notes:** *To measure students' mastery of the
language objective, ask them to write an explanation of what the
remainder of this problem means and describe how to use it to solve the
problem.*

-   When writing or speaking is the output Language Skill/Domain use the
    boilerplate: ***"Use similar scaffolds to those provided in the
    Emergent Bilinguals Teaching Strategy for Spark*** ***Your Learning
    to ensure the students have appropriate \[writing/speaking\]
    supports."***

-   When representing is the Language Skill/Domain for the lesson, use
    this boilerplate: ***"Use similar scaffolds to those provided in the
    Emergent Bilinguals Teaching Strategy for Spark*** ***Your Learning
    to ensure the students have appropriate supports to represent their
    work."***

**After Quick Check:**

Use the boilerplate with the appropriate domain: ***Use similar
scaffolds to those provided in the Emergent Bilinguals Teaching Strategy
for Spark Your Learning to ensure the students have appropriate
\[speaking, writing\] supports.***

***Use similar scaffolds to those provided in the Emergent Bilinguals
Teaching Strategy for Spark Your Learning to ensure the students have
appropriate supports to represent their work.***

Followed by task specific support using a strategy previously used in
the lesson.

***Example: The remainder in this problem are the \_\_\_\_. I need to
\_\_\_\_ so there are enough batteries.***

# NGSSS Alignment Guide
**Next Generation Sunshine State Standards for Science**
**Source:** Florida Department of Education
**Applies To:** K-8 Science (Florida only)

---

## Overview

**Florida uses NGSSS (Next Generation Sunshine State Standards)** for K-8 science, which are NGSS-aligned but use Florida-specific standard codes. Materials must align to NGSSS benchmarks and integrate ESOL/WIDA language support.

**Core Principle:** NGSSS follows NGSS three-dimensional learning framework (Science Practices + Big Ideas + Nature of Science) with Florida-specific organization and coding.

## NGSSS vs. NGSS vs. TEKS Science

| Aspect | NGSSS (Florida) | NGSS (California) | TEKS (Texas) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Standard Format** | SC.{Grade}.{Strand}.{Standard} | {Grade}-{Domain}{Number}-{PE} | {Grade}.{Strand}.{Standard} |
| **Example** | SC.5.P.8.1 | 5-PS1-3 | 5.5A |
| **Organization** | Big Ideas + Practices + Nature of Science | 3D (SEP+DCI+CCC) | Strand-based |
| **Alignment** | NGSS-aligned (similar content) | National NGSS | Different framework |
| **Emphasis** | Florida ecosystems, inquiry, Big Ideas | 3D integration, phenomena | Hands-on, testable, observable |

---

## NGSSS Standard Format

### Structure:

**Format:** `SC.{Grade}.{Strand}.{Standard}.{Benchmark}`

**Example:** `SC.5.P.8.1`

**Breakdown:**
- `SC` = Science
- `5` = Grade 5
- `P` = Physical Science strand
- `8` = Big Idea 8 (Properties of Matter)
- `1` = Benchmark #1 within Big Idea

---

## NGSSS Strands and Big Ideas

### Science Content Strands:

**P = Physical Science**
- Big Ideas 8-13 (Properties of Matter, Changes in Matter, Forms of Energy, Energy Transfer, Motion, Forces)

**E = Earth and Space Science**
- Big Ideas 5-7 (Earth in Space and Time, Earth Structures, Earth Systems and Patterns)

**L = Life Science**
- Big Ideas 14-17 (Organization and Development of Living Things, Diversity and Evolution, Heredity and Reproduction, Interdependence)

**N = Nature of Science** (all grades)
- Big Ideas 1-3 (Practice of Science, Characteristics of Scientific Knowledge, Role of Theories/Laws/Hypotheses/Models)

---

## Nature of Science (Strand N)

### Unique to NGSSS:

**Florida includes "Nature of Science" as explicit strand** across all grades:

**Big Idea 1: The Practice of Science**
- Scientific inquiry methods
- Experimental design
- Data collection and analysis
- Safety and ethics

**Big Idea 2: The Characteristics of Scientific Knowledge**
- Science is empirical
- Science is replicable
- Science is subject to change with new evidence
- Science is based on evidence

**Big Idea 3: The Role of Theories, Laws, Hypotheses, and Models**
- Understanding scientific models
- Difference between theory and law
- Hypothesis formation

**Example (Grade 5):**
```
SC.5.N.1.1
Define a problem, use appropriate reference materials to support scientific
understanding, plan and carry out scientific investigations, and identify
variables.

SC.5.N.2.1
Recognize and explain that science is grounded in empirical observations
that are testable; explanation must always be consistent with experimental
and observational evidence.
```

**Note:** Similar to TEKS Strand 1 (Scientific Investigation) but more explicit about nature of science

---

## Big Ideas Framework

### NGSSS Organizes Content by "Big Ideas":

**Physical Science (P):**
- **Big Idea 8:** Properties of Matter

- **Big Idea 10:** Forms of Energy
- **Big Idea 11:** Energy Transfer and Transformations
- **Big Idea 12:** Motion of Objects
- **Big Idea 13:** Forces and Changes in Motion

**Earth and Space Science (E):**
- **Big Idea 5:** Earth in Space and Time
- **Big Idea 6:** Earth Structures
- **Big Idea 7:** Earth Systems and Patterns

**Life Science (L):**
- **Big Idea 14:** Organization and Development of Living Organisms
- **Big Idea 15:** Diversity and Evolution of Living Organisms
- **Big Idea 16:** Heredity and Reproduction

---

## NGSSS and NGSS Alignment

### How NGSSS Relates to NGSS:

**Alignment:**
- NGSSS content closely parallels NGSS Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs)
- Science Practices similar to NGSS SEPs
- Nature of Science overlaps with Crosscutting Concepts and practices

**Differences:**
- Different standard codes (SC.5.P.8.1 vs. 5-PS1-3)
- Different organization (Big Ideas vs. Performance Expectations)
- Florida-specific examples and contexts

**Mapping:**
Most NGSSS benchmarks can be mapped to NGSS Performance Expectations, but codes differ.

**Example Mapping:**

**NGSSS:**
```
SC.5.P.8.1
Compare and contrast the basic properties of solids, liquids, and gases,
such as mass, volume, color, texture, and temperature.
```

**NGSS Equivalent:**
```
5-PS1-3
Make observations and measurements to identify materials based on their
properties.
```

**Similarity:** Both focus on properties of matter, observation, measurement
**Difference:** NGSSS more specific about which properties; NGSS more general

## CER (Claim-Evidence-Reasoning) in NGSSS

### Florida Uses CER Framework:

**Claim:**
- Answer to scientific question
- Statement based on investigation

**Evidence:**
- Data collected during investigation
- Observations and measurements

**Reasoning:**
- Explanation of how evidence supports claim
- Connection to scientific principles

**Example (Grade 5 States of Matter):**

**Question:** What state of matter is water at room temperature?

**Claim:** Water at room temperature is a liquid.

**Evidence:** I observed that water in the container had a definite volume but took the shape of its container. When I poured it, it flowed. The thermometer showed 22°C (room temperature).

**Reasoning:** Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container. Solids have both definite volume and shape, and gases have neither. Since water had volume but no definite shape, it must be a liquid.

**See Also:** `/subjects/science/common/ngss-alignment-guide.md` (CER Framework - REUSE!)

## Implementation Guidance

### Lesson Planning for NGSSS:

**Step 1: Identify NGSSS Benchmark**
- Content benchmark (Strand P, E, or L)
- Nature of Science benchmark (Strand N)

**Step 2: Design Inquiry Investigation**
- What question will drive investigation?
- What will students observe, measure, test?
- What data will they collect?

**Step 3: Plan Lesson Sequence (5E or similar)**
- **Engage:** Hook, activate prior knowledge
- **Explore:** Hands-on investigation
- **Explain:** Vocabulary, concepts, explanations
- **Elaborate:** Extend to new contexts
- **Evaluate:** Assess understanding

**Step 4: Integrate ESOL/WIDA**
- Identify language demands (vocabulary, syntax, discourse)
- Plan scaffolds for multiple WIDA levels
- Sentence frames, visuals, bilingual support

**Step 5: Use Florida Context**
- Can you use Florida ecosystems, weather, or resources as examples?
- Make real-world connections to Florida

**Step 6: Validate Alignment**
- Does activity address benchmark fully?
- Is Nature of Science integrated?
- Are ESOL/WIDA supports included?
- Is investigation hands-on and inquiry-based?

---

**Remember:** NGSSS is NGSS-aligned but uses Florida-specific Big Ideas organization and benchmark codes. The Nature of Science strand is explicit (Strand N) and should be integrated into all lessons. Content is 85-90% reusable from NGSS common files, with Florida-specific context, ESOL/WIDA scaffolding, and statutory compliance being the main differences. When designing for Florida, always include hands-on inquiry, Nature of Science practices, robust ESOL/WIDA supports for diverse learners, and Florida-relevant examples when possible.

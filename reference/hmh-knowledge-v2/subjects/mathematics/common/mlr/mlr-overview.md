# Mathematical Language Routines (MLR) Overview
**Source:** Mathematical Language Routines (MLR) Guidelines
**Updated:** July 2024
**Total Routines:** 8

---

## Overview

**Mathematical Language Routines (MLR)** provide structured opportunities for students to listen, speak, read, and write about mathematical situations. These routines develop both mathematical language and conceptual understanding simultaneously.

**Core Philosophy:** Language and content are inseparable. MLRs build mathematical understanding THROUGH language development, not after it.

---

## The 8 MLR Routines

### Quick Reference:

| MLR | Name | Primary Use | When to Use |
|-----|------|-------------|-------------|
| **MLR1** | Stronger and Clearer Each Time | Refining explanations through peer feedback | After solving, when students explain thinking |
| **MLR2** | Collect and Display | Capturing and displaying student language | During partner/group work to build vocabulary wall |
| **MLR3** | Critique, Correct, and Clarify | Analyzing and improving flawed work | When flawed explanation exists to analyze |
| **MLR4** | Information Gap | Problem-solving through questioning | Requires special task design (rare) |
| **MLR5** | Co-Craft Questions and Problems | Students create mathematical questions | Special activities (less common) |
| **MLR6** | Three Reads | Making sense of contextual problems | **MOST USED** - Every SYL, most Tasks |
| **MLR7** | Compare and Connect | Comparing strategies and representations | After solving, when multiple approaches exist |
| **MLR8** | Discussion Supports | Facilitating rich mathematical discourse | During any discussion to deepen participation |

## Where MLRs Are Used in Into Math TX

### Module Planning (Teacher Edition):
- MLRs embedded in lessons are listed with lesson numbers
- Example: "Three Reads (Lessons 3.1, 3.2, 3.4)"

### Lesson Level - 3 Placement Options:

**A. Spark Your Learning (SYL):**
- **Default:** MLR6 Three Reads (required for contextual problems)
- **If non-contextual:** No MLR; use simplified text

**B. Tasks - START Section (before solving):**
- **Default:** MLR6 Three Reads (for contextual problems)
- **If non-contextual:** No MLR; use simplified text

**C. Tasks - THEN Section (after solving):**
- **Options:** MLR1, 2, 3, 7, or 8
- **Purpose:** Discuss thinking, compare strategies, refine explanations

**Important Rules:**
- ⚠️ **Do NOT use the same MLR twice within one Task**
- ⚠️ **Consider varying MLRs across Tasks** (not always the same routine)

---

## MLR1: Stronger and Clearer Each Time

### Purpose:
Provide structured opportunity for students to **revise and refine** their ideas and verbal/written output through iterative sharing and feedback.

### When to Use:
- After students solve a problem
- When students need to explain or describe thinking
- When peer feedback can strengthen understanding

### Where to Embed:
**Tasks (after solving):**
"**THEN,** have students use the **Stronger and Clearer Each Time** routine to discuss their thinking."

### How It Works:
1. **Write:** Students write reasoning for [problem]
2. **Share:** In pairs, students share their thinking
3. **Question:** Partners ask clarifying questions
4. **Refine:** Students revise their reasoning based on feedback
5. **Repeat:** (optional) Share with new partner, refine again

### Implementation Text:
```
Have students write down their reasoning for [insert problem] and any
questions about it. Then in pairs, have students share their thinking.
Remind students to ask questions of each other that focus on describing
their thinking, especially related to [insert key concept or strategy],
and to then use insights from the discussion to refine their answers or
reasoning.
```

### Example:
"Have students write down their reasoning for solving the division problem and any questions about it. Then in pairs, have students share their thinking. Remind students to ask questions of each other that focus on describing their thinking, and to then use insights from the discussion to refine their answers or reasoning."

### Benefits:
- Multiple exposures to mathematical language
- Practice explaining and listening
- Refinement through feedback
- Builds confidence in mathematical communication

---

## MLR2: Collect and Display

### Purpose:
Capture students' oral words and phrases into a **stable, collective reference** (vocabulary wall, anchor chart).

### When to Use:
- During partner or small group work
- When students use mathematical vocabulary worth preserving
- When building shared mathematical language

### Where to Embed:
**Tasks (after solving):**
"**THEN,** have students use the **Collect and Display** routine to discuss their thinking."

### How It Works:
1. **Circulate:** Teacher listens to student discussions
2. **Capture:** Write key words, phrases, sketches, diagrams on display
3. **Reference:** Point to display during whole-class discussion
4. **Use:** Students use displayed language to communicate precisely

### Implementation Text:
```
During pair/group work, circulate and listen to student discussion.
Write common or important words, phrases, sketches, or diagrams such as
[insert key mathematical concept(s)] on a visual display for students to
see. Refer back to the display during whole-class discussion to help
students communicate ideas more precisely.
```

### Example:
"During pair/group work, circulate and listen to student discussion. Write common or important words, phrases, sketches, or diagrams such as the area of a rectangle and triangle on a visual display for students to see. Refer back to the display during whole class discussion to help students communicate ideas more precisely."

### Benefits:
- Elevates student language (not just teacher's)
- Creates shared reference for class
- Supports emergent bilinguals
- Documents mathematical thinking over time

---

## MLR3: Critique, Correct, and Clarify

### Purpose:
Give students mathematical writing that is **not their own** to analyze, reflect on, and improve.

### When to Use:
- When problem contains flawed explanation, argument, or solution
- When students can learn from analyzing errors
- Picked up from v1 content

### Where to Embed:
**Tasks (after solving):**
"**THEN,** have students use the **Critique, Correct, and Clarify** routine to discuss their thinking."

### How It Works:
1. **Present:** Show flawed work (from problem or created)
2. **Critique:** Students identify errors or unclear parts
3. **Discuss:** Partners discuss what's wrong and why
4. **Correct:** Students fix the errors
5. **Clarify:** Students improve the explanation
6. **Share:** Refined explanations shared with class

### Implementation:
Draw attention to the explanation, argument, or solution method that will be analyzed. Have students discuss their critique and correction. Then have students refine the response.

### Example:
"Point out to students that in Task 3, Jesse placed a tick mark for every $2 on her number line. Encourage students to describe to a partner why the club expenses could be graphed correctly without a tick mark for every dollar on the number line. Students should then refine their responses after discussing with a partner."

### Benefits:
- Low-risk error analysis (not their own work)
- Develops mathematical critique skills
- Strengthens understanding through correction
- Builds precise mathematical communication

---

## MLR4: Information Gap

### Purpose:
**(Less commonly used)** Students engage in problem-solving by identifying needed information and asking questions to obtain it.

### When to Use:
- Requires special task design (information split between partners)
- Rarely embedded in standard content
- More common in special activities

### Note:
This MLR requires specific task structure where one student has information the other needs. Not typically used in standard lesson flow.

---

## MLR5: Co-Craft Questions and Problems

### Purpose:
**(Less commonly used)** Students create mathematical questions or problems, developing understanding of problem structure.

### When to Use:
- Special activities focused on problem creation
- Rarely embedded in standard content
- More common in extension or enrichment

### Note:
This MLR is used in specific activities designed for student problem creation, not in typical lesson tasks.

---

## MLR6: Three Reads

### Purpose:
Ensure students understand what they're being asked to do; create opportunities to reflect on how mathematical questions are presented; equip students with tools to negotiate meaning.

### When to Use:
- **Most frequently used MLR**
- For word or contextual problems
- **CANNOT** be used for non-contextual problems (computation only)

### Where to Embed:
**SYL:** "**Now**, use the **Three Reads** routine to support students in understanding the problem."

**Tasks (before solving):** "**Start** the task by making sure the students understand the problem. The **Three Reads** routine can help support students make sense of the problem."

### The Three Reads Structure:

**Read 1: Context** - "What is the problem about?"
- Focus: Understand the situation
- Goal: Comprehend context without numbers or question
- Example Response: "Aiden is building solar toy cars and buying wheels for them."

**Read 2: Quantities** - "What numbers are important? Why?"
- Focus: Identify and understand quantities
- Goal: Recognize mathematical information
- Example Response: "18 and 4; Because that's how many wheels Aiden bought, and each car needs 4 wheels."

**Read 3: Question** - What question is being asked?
- Focus: The specific question to answer
- Goal: Clarify what needs to be found
- Example Response: *How many cars can Aiden build?*
- Note: Question in italics (not annotation)

### Special Considerations:
**Avoiding Overset:** If Three Reads used in both SYL and multiple Tasks:
- Include FULL text in first use (SYL or Task 1)
- In subsequent Tasks, include ONLY the "**ASK**" portions

### Implementation Text (Full Version):
```
1. First Read: Students read or listen to the problem with a focus on
   the context of the problem. The teacher starts a class discussion
   with the goal of students comprehending the text.

   ASK: What is the problem about? [Insert one-sentence summary]

2. Second Read: Reread the problem with a focus on what the quantities
   represent.

   ASK: What numbers are important? Why are they important? [Insert
   values and why they're important]

3. Third Read: Reread the problem for the third time with a focus on
   the question being asked: [Insert question in italics]

   Have students brainstorm possible strategies and engage in independent
   think time before solving the problem.
```

### Benefits:
- Reduces cognitive load
- Supports emergent bilinguals
- Ensures comprehension before solving
- Systematic approach to word problems
- Most effective routine for contextual problems

## MLR7: Compare and Connect

### Purpose:
Foster students' meta-awareness as they **identify, compare, and contrast** different mathematical approaches, representations, concepts, examples, and language.

### When to Use:
- After solving, when multiple strategies exist
- When students can compare their thinking
- When contrasting different approaches deepens understanding

### Where to Embed:
**Tasks (after solving):**
"**THEN,** have students use the **Compare and Connect** routine to discuss their thinking."

### How It Works:
**Option A: Compare Terms/Concepts**
- Students describe two key terms in their own words
- Partners discuss descriptions
- Class connects similarities and differences

**Option B: Compare Strategies**
- Students discuss two methods or strategies
- Partners discuss which they prefer and why
- Class connects why different methods work

### Implementation Text:

**For Comparing Terms:**
```
Introduce and discuss the new term [vocabulary]. Invite students to
describe [term A] and [term B] in their own words, and then discuss
their descriptions.
```

**For Comparing Strategies:**
```
After students have completed [parts], have them discuss the two methods.
Ask them which method they liked best and why. [Optional: introduce
vocabulary or connect concepts]
```

### Examples:

**Example 1 (Terms):**
"Introduce and discuss the new term *array*. Invite students to describe a row and a column in their own words, and then discuss their descriptions."

**Example 2 (Strategies):**
"After students have completed Parts C and D, have them discuss the two methods. Ask them which method they liked best and why. Point out to students that the term *simplify* means to write a fraction so that the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1."

### Benefits:
- Develops meta-awareness of mathematical choices
- Validates multiple approaches
- Deepens understanding through comparison
- Builds flexible mathematical thinking

## MLR8: Discussion Supports

### Purpose:
Support **rich and inclusive discussions** about mathematical ideas, representations, contexts, and strategies.

### When to Use:
- During any student discussion
- When teacher wants to deepen participation
- When facilitating whole-class sharing

### Where to Embed:
**Tasks (after solving):**
"**THEN,** use the **Discussion Supports** routine to help students discuss their thinking."

**Note:** Slightly different boilerplate (teacher-focused, not "have students use")

### How It Works:
**Choose ONE support from these options:**

1. **Revoice** student discussion to model precise mathematical language use when explaining thinking about [problem]. Ask clarifying questions to help students apply appropriate language.

2. **Press for details** in explanation of [problem]. Have students challenge or critique an explanation or elaborate and give examples to support an explanation.

3. **Represent multi-modally** by inviting students to act out scenarios or showing videos/images related to [key concept].

4. **Practice vocabulary** through choral response of terms [insert key concepts].

5. **Think aloud** about [key concept] while solving [problem].

6. **Detail approach** to solving [problem] or describe and justify thinking to demonstrate use of mathematical terms such as [insert key concepts].

7. **Check-in protocol** - Provide time for students within groups to check in with one another to ensure everyone can explain or justify their approach. Then call on variety of students from each group to ensure participation.

### Implementation:
Choose ONE support strategy and insert problem-specific details.

### Example:
"**THEN,** use the **Discussion Supports** routine to help students discuss their thinking.

Revoice student discussion to model precise mathematical language use when explaining their reasoning for finding the area of the rectangle. Ask clarifying questions to help students apply appropriate language."

### Benefits:
- Scaffolds participation for all students
- Models mathematical discourse
- Deepens engagement
- Supports emergent bilinguals
- Flexible—choose support that fits need

## MLR Selection Decision Tree

### Step 1: Timing - Before or After Solving?

**BEFORE solving (understand the problem):**
→ Is it a contextual/word problem?
  - **YES** → Use **MLR6: Three Reads**
  - **NO** → No MLR (use simplified text: "make sure students understand problem")

**AFTER solving (discuss thinking):**
→ Go to Step 2

---

### Step 2: What's the Goal of Discussion?

**Goal: Refine explanations through peer feedback**
→ **MLR1: Stronger and Clearer Each Time**

**Goal: Build vocabulary wall from student language**
→ **MLR2: Collect and Display**

**Goal: Analyze and improve flawed work**
→ **MLR3: Critique, Correct, and Clarify**
(Requires flawed work to analyze)

**Goal: Compare different strategies or terms**
→ **MLR7: Compare and Connect**

**Goal: Facilitate richer discussion (teacher-led support)**
→ **MLR8: Discussion Supports**

---

### Step 3: Check for Variety
- Have you already used this MLR in this task? → Choose different one
- Have you used the same MLR in multiple tasks? → Consider variety

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### Module Planning:
1. Review all SYL and Tasks
2. Identify which MLRs are embedded
3. List MLRs under "Mathematical Language Routines (MLRs)" section
4. Format: MLR title (without number) + lesson numbers in parentheses
5. Example: "Three Reads (Lessons 3.1, 3.2, 3.4)"

### Tracking MLRs:
Use Item-Level MegaTrackers:
- [K-5 Item-Level Megatracker](https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/QjCMvh7G65Cwv9C6mxR5PJwf4jPxH96HcQ943vf1)
- [6-A1 Item-Level Megatracker](https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/mJrR63Jv9QW6X3G93Q4G8qhvJM5Cx7HQGm656Pg1)

**Track:**
- MLR selected for SYL
- MLR selected for Task START section
- MLR selected for Task THEN section
- "No MLR" if none used

### Pick-Up from v1:
- Preserve MLRs from reused v1 SYL or Tasks
- For new content, follow decision tree

---

## Integration with Other Supports

### MLR + EB Scaffolds:
- MLRs provide structure
- EB scaffolds provide language support within that structure
- Example: MLR6 Three Reads + EB sentence frames for each read

### MLR + UDL:
- MLRs support UDL Representation (multiple ways to access content)
- MLRs support UDL Engagement (multiple entry points)
- Example: MLR2 Collect and Display + UDL Representation (visual vocabulary wall)

### MLR + Language Objective:
- Language Objective states WHAT language students will develop
- MLR states HOW students will develop that language
- Example: Language Objective "Explain strategies for division" + MLR1 Stronger and Clearer Each Time

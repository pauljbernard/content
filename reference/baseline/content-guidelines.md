-   To create parity between static content and digital content.

-   Have print match digital from the outset, preventing having to edit
    print to match digital or vice versa.

-   To create **"GOLD"** content within one document that can branch out
    into 3 or morevo workflows (SE,TE, iSE, Learnosity, ClassCraft).

-   To optimize the schedule to deliver programs quickly.

-   To deliver more components on the same timeline or closer together.

[]{#_Toc1843501125 .anchor}Module and Lesson Structure for Program -
(The v2 story)

Into Math NL V2 and CA is based on Into Math V1 with significant edits.
Lessons will be grouped by module, then by volume. Into Math NL V2 and
CA will not have units. All content for Into Math NL V2 and CA will be
contained in the EMMs. We will not be using tearsheets for reused V1
content.

## How to Approach the Content -- LXDV Guidelines and Resources

Ensure that manuscript meets the readability requirements for the grade
level and content is presented in a grade-level appropriate manner.

A

Review these documents before starting development:

#### California Mathematics Framework

> Please read the [California Mathematics Framework
> Guidelines](https://hmhco.box.com/s/97w8xfqi6plw8x8kdndsof6pbjq7zjwe)
> for general understanding. There are additional guidelines with
> specifics for how the Drivers of Investigation, Content Connections,
> and Standards of Mathematical Practice should appear in content. These
> will be linked in the guidelines at point-of-use.

#### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Guidelines

> These guidelines are overriding guidelines. They are mindset
> guidelines and need to be considered and implemented in the
> composition of any piece of the Math Program. They should be
> considered in the broadest possible terms. That is, they govern
> everything from name selection in student-facing materials to
> selection of imagery to creation of art and tech art. Our goal is to
> have an approachable, friendly, accessible program in which every
> student can see themselves represented and every student can think of
> themselves as not only capable, but fluent in Mathematics.
>
> See the [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
> Guidelines](https://hmhco.box.com/s/1pzlyh15hh2qj7y6butm903ybil7f287)
> **for specifics on topics and how they should be represented in
> content.**

#### NLv2/CA TOCs and Lesson Notes

> The TOCs for the NLv2/CA program are in Excel spreadsheets located in
> subfolders of [this
> folder](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci). For
> each grade's TOC, there is also a Word doc with notes for all new and
> revised lessons to guide the development of those lessons. For
> example, the screenshot below shows the TOC and lesson notes for Grade
> 4.
>
> ![](media/image2.png){width="3.1112707786526683in"
> height="1.027830271216098in"}
>
> Detailed guidelines for using the TOCs and lesson notes can be found
> [here](https://hmhco.box.com/s/b8hsicapupkbm4uxzrjd1i9e5qsdpuk9). The
> following are important high-level points to keep in mind:

-   **The lesson notes don't account for all revisions needed.** The
    notes describe the revisions to each lesson's instructional tasks
    that are required to meet California's math content standards. The
    LXDV will need to make similar revisions to the lesson's Quick Check
    and Practice On Your Own exercises so that the content of the tasks
    and exercises aligns. Moreover, additional revisions will be needed
    to meet quotas for coverage of California's Standards for
    Mathematical Practice (SMPs), Drivers of Investigation (DIs), and
    Environmental Principles and Concepts (EP&Cs), and to address
    California's [social content
    guidelines](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/documents/socialcontent2013.doc)
    (e.g., we can't have problems about pizza or other foods that CA
    might deem unhealthy).

-   **The LXDV should query HMH if they have a question or concern about
    the TOCs or lesson notes.** If something in the TOCs or lesson notes
    is unclear or doesn't seem to make sense, the LXDV should reach out
    to HMH for clarification. Since the LXDV is looking at the content
    with a fresh set of eyes, it's possible they will notice errors,
    ambiguities, or opportunities for improvement that were missed by
    HMH.

#### 

#### California Math Standards Breakouts Charts

The [California Math Standards Breakouts
Charts](https://hmhco.app.box.com/folder/269804202345?s=x9it4w30jsp40zt13msya3h3zvdwz1t6)
break down each grade level standard and provide the lesson and Task/SYL
that hit the breakout. Access the grade level breakout chart as you cite
and use standards when authoring to ensure your content meets the hit
locations.

**Reach out to your HMH contact if:**

-   Standard(s) listed for a lesson are inaccurate.

-   Additional standards or hit locations can be cited for this lesson
    that are not documented in the Standards Breakout Chart

#### Quotas for Teaching Strategy/Teaching Support (Session-Level Only)

> Guidelines for writing **Multilingual Learners (ML)**, **UDL**, and
> **Common Error** supports in Spark Your Learning, Tasks, and Quick
> Check are referenced within those sections of the Lesson-Level
> Guidelines, however, refer to the following list for quotas and
> placement of the supports.
>
> Be sure the following is true for the three types of supports:

-   There is no more than 2 Teaching Strategies/Supports per either task
    or T&T.

-   Each Teaching Strategy/Support box should identify the specific type
    of support.

-   Common Error Support occurs only after a Task.

-   Minimum of 1 Common Error Supports for lessons with 2--4 Tasks, and
    minimum of 2 Common Error Supports for lessons with 5+ Tasks.

-   UDL Strategy occurs after a Task or with T&T.

-   Minimum of 2 UDL Teaching Strategies per lesson.

-   ML Strategy exists after SYL Discussions or SYL T&T.

-   Minimum of 1 ML Strategy exists after a Task or with a T&T.

-   ML Strategy exists with Review SYL.

-   ML Strategy exists with Quick Check.

Make sure to pay close attention to print-to-digital parity, detailed in
the guidelines at point-of-use.

# Lesson Level Guidelines 

#### 

## Page 1 and Before You Teach

### Page 1

1.  [Introduction]{.underline}

    -   This is the recording keeping page that is for internal use
        only. Every lesson will include this table.

    -   This page that ensures that the new content name/code marries up
        correctly with the source material. It also holds the metadata
        details for the lesson.

    -   The first column is boilerplate.

    -   The links to the V1 PDFs will be referenced throughout the rest
        of the guidelines, for all sections.

2.  [Determine if content can be reused with edits or new content needs
    to be written.]{.underline}

-   In "Grade" row, insert the correct grade number (or title for
    Algebra 1)

-   In "Lesson" row, insert the correct lesson number in the format
    "#.#" such as 12.1.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   This can be found in the grade level ToC, column A "Mod/Lesson" in
    the [TOC & LXDV Notes Box
    Folder.](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   In "Lesson Title" row, insert the lesson title.

    -   This can be found in the grade level ToC, column B "Title" in
        the [TOC & LXDV Notes Box
        Folder.](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)

        -   Be sure to not use the titles in rows labeled "Module #". We
            want lesson level titles here.

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
    -   In "V1 Source Lesson(s) row, insert the correct lesson number in
        the format "#.#" such as 12.1.

        -   This can be found in the grade level ToC, column C "Source"
            in the [TOC & LXDV Notes Box
            Folder.](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci).
            It is not necessary to include the NL designation.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   In "V1 TE PDF Lesson(s) Link" row, insert a hyperlink to the NL PDFs
    used as the base for this lesson.

    -   PDFs for NL V1 are posted here:

As you work through the EMM, update the page numbers in the table of
contents section on page 1.

-   Right click or control click on the chart.

    -   Select "Update Field" (Desktop version) or "Update Table of
        Contents" (Online Version).

    -   Select "Update Page Numbers Only" (Desktop version) or "Update
        Table of Contents" (Online Version).

### Before You Teach 

1.  [Introduction]{.underline}

    -   This is the teacher-facing planning page.

    -   This page captures all the resources (standards, materials,
        etc.) that a teacher needs to gather or understand prior to
        teaching the lesson.

    -   Boilerplate:

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
    -   The heads of each section (denoted by the orange color).

    -   "Digital Authoring Within:" under the Before You Teach head
        should always read "TBD.

    -   Additional examples of boilerplate are identified under each
        subsection

2.  [Determine if content can be reused with edits or new content needs
    to be written.]{.underline}

-   For lessons that are revised (minor and major), much of this content
    will be reusable as is.

-   For lessons that are new, this content will be new.

**"What should I understand about the math?"**

1.  [Introduction]{.underline}

    -   This is the teacher-facing lesson summary.

    -   It explains what is covered in the lesson, and lives right next
        to the standards so the teacher understands the correlation
        between the two.

> **What should I understand about the math?** is boilerplate (and bold)

2.  [Determine if content can be reused with edits or new content needs
    to be written.]{.underline}

-   For pick up or lightly revised lessons, the lesson summary can be
    reused from V1.

-   For new lessons this content will be new.

3.  [Steps for Reused Content]{.underline}

-   Access the planning "A" page of the NL V1 from the lesson in the [V1
    TE PDFs Box

**THIS LESSON-- National Layer**

1.  [Introduction]{.underline}

    1.  This is the Common Core standard(s) "hit" within the lesson.

    2.  The purpose of this table is to document what standards are
        covered within the lesson, and ensure full coverage,

    3.  None of the content is boilerplate, however it is narrowly
        focused because it is derived from a specific set of
        information.

    4.  **In most cases the NL layer and California layer will be
        identical.**

2.  [Determine if content can be reused with edits or new content needs
    to be written.]{.underline}

-   Open the grade level TOC within the [TOC & LXDV Notes
    Folder](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci).

-   Use the Table of Contents (TOC) to determine the standards for the
    lesson and which standards are Focus, Apply, and Introduce by using
    the columns labeled "Standards -- Focus", "Standards -- Apply", and
    "Standards -- Introduce".

-   In the EMM, set in rows in order of Focus, Apply, and Introduce.

-   **Focus-** a permutation of the standard is used for the parts hit
    within the lesson. Remove any parts of the standard not covered in
    the lesson and replace missing sections with ellipses.

-   [To avoid overset on Lesson Planning pages, Standards language

**How do I provide data-driven individualized support?**

1.  [Introduction]{.underline}

    -   This section provides teachers with differentiated instruction
        and practice opportunities to support their students.

    -   This section is almost entirely boilerplate except for the end
        of the sentence in brackets.

2.  [Steps for Placing Content]{.underline}

    -   Use the language from the Learning Goal (I Can statement) to
        complete the sentences under **Differentiated Instruction** and
        **Practice Opportunities**.

        -   Do not include "I can" from the statement. Use the action
            from the statement to complete the sentence.

#### 

## Learning Goal (Beginning and End) 

1.  Introduction

-   The Learning Goal is set in place so that both teachers and students
    have a clear understanding of the content to be learned in an
    upcoming lesson.

-   The Learning *Goal* is the "I can" statement which appears in
    several sections throughout the lesson level pages: **Before You
    Teach**, **Get Ready** (Set Learning Goals), and **Assess**
    (Learning Goal).

    -   The Learning Goal is a student facing goal for the lesson and
        must be written in student friendly verbiage. Before pasting the
        Learning Goal into the template, review the verbiage to
        determine if it is written in a student-friendly manner. Revise
        the Learning Goal, if needed, to ensure it includes words that
        are appropriate for the grade-level audience.

-   The Learning Goal will need to be placed within the respective
    sections of the Lesson-Level EMM.

2.  Determine if content can be reused from V1 (Reused Content), reused
    from V1 with edits (Revised Content) or new content that needs to be
    written from Scratch (New Content).

-   The Learning Goal will remain the same each time it is referenced
    throughout a lesson. Each lesson will have its own Learning Goal.

-   The Learning Goal will either be reused from a source lesson in
    NLv1, or in cases where the lesson has been revised or is entirely
    new, you will need to reference the correct grade level New &
    Revised Lesson Notes in the [TOC Box
    Folder.](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)

-   To determine whether or not the Learning Goal is coming from a
    source lesson in NLV1 or the LXDV notes, refer to the specific grade
    level Table of Contents (Excel Sheet) within the [TOC Box
    Folder](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci).

3.  Steps for Reused Content

    -   Refer to the specific grade level Table of Contents within the
        [TOC Box
        Folder](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)
        and find Column D. If a lesson is marked as PU, it is considered
        a "pick-up," and the Learning Goal can be found directly in the
        source lesson of the NLV1 Teacher Edition:

        i.  Open the corresponding source lesson in the Teacher Edition.

        ii. Locate the Lesson Opener page (A page)

        iii. Locate and copy the content from under **Lesson Focus and
             Coherence**

-   **[Finding and Placing the Learning Goal:]{.underline}**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   In the **Lesson Focus and Coherence** section of the source lesson's
    A page, copy the I Can Objective. Determine if the language in the I
    Can objective is appropriate for the grade level. If so, copy it. If
    not, revise it so that the language is student-friendly.

-   Once copied, go back to the EMM and scroll down near the bottom of
    the **Before You Teach** section and paste the I Can Objective from
    the source lesson into the Learning Goal box on the EMM.

-   Scroll down to the first blue **Get Ready (Set Learning Goals)**
    section of the EMM. This section consists of both digital and print
    Student Content, as well as TE Teacher Notes for both Classcraft and
    Print.

-   Separate platforms are being used depending on grade band to author
    the digital content:

## Spark Your Learning and Review Spark Your Learning

### Step 1: Introducing the Spark Your Learning Components 

The Spark Your Learning sets up learning for the lesson. The objective
of the Spark Your Learning item is to bridge mathematical content,
elicit and address common errors, activate prior knowledge, and require
student perseverance. The SYL is focused on foundational prerequisite
learning. We should not be introducing any new skills but rather the
skills needed to support the introduction of the new skill. Review the
table below that shows the components of the SYL. **Then move to step
2-6 for guidance on how to write each component.**

+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

Step 2: Learning about the V2 Lesson

Before beginning the SYL editing and authoring process refer to the
grade level [Table of
Contents](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci) and
grade level New & Revised Lesson Document, which can be found in the
Table of Contents Folder.

New & Revised Lesson Document: The new and revised lesson document
contains any notes or guidance for the V2 lesson. This document should
be read for each lesson prior to any work being complete. Specific
instructions may be indicated for each lesson. Follow all instructions
listed in this document.

TOC Column D: Refer to the specific grade level [Table of
Contents](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci) and
find column D. Column D indicates if the new V2 lesson is a PU, REV,
COMB, SPLIT, or NEW lesson.

-   If column D indicates a COMB lesson, this means the new V2 lesson
    has two V1 source lessons. In these cases, the New and Revised
    Lesson Document will tell you which source lesson to pick-up the SYL
    item from or if a new SYL is needed.

TOC Column L: Refer to the specific grade level [Table of
Contents](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci) and
find column L. Column L indicates if content can be reused from V1 with
edits or new content needs to be written from scratch.

-   If column L is blank, there is an existing SYL in V1 that needs to
    be evaluated to determine if certain components of V1 can be reused
    along, with the new additions that will need to be added. **For
    grade K-8 move to step 3. For Algebra 1 move to step 4.**

-   If column L indicates a Y for a lesson, then a new SYL needs to be
    created and ALL components will need to be written from scratch,
    **move to step 5.**

### Step 3: Evaluating and Editing the V1 Components of a K-8 SYL 

In this step you will locate and review all the V1 SYL components of the
K-8 source lesson in the V1 Teacher Edition. The source lesson is
identified in the grade level [Table of
Contents](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)
column C. The SYL developer will be evaluating the existing V1 SYL item,
turn and talk, common error, and common strategy, to determine if these
existing SYL components can be reused with edits and new scripting in
V2. The developer will need the Teacher Edition of the V1 source lesson
along with the grade level New and Revised Lesson Document and the grade
level [Table of
Contents](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci).
Follow any special instructions, if given, in the New and Revised Lesson
Document.

3a) Evaluate the V1 SYL Item: To evaluate the V1 SYL item for V2
criteria ask the following questions about the SYL item:

-   Does the SYL item elicit the common errors identified for this
    lesson?

-   Is the context of the SYL item culturally sensitive, keeping in mind
    the background of all students?

-   Does the SYL match the suggested time completion for the grade band
    from the start of the item to the conclusion of the Turn and Talk?

    -   K-2: 5-10 minutes

    -   3-5: 10-15 minutes

    -   6-A1: About 15 minutes

-   Is the SYL item solvable using multiple strategies and approaches?
    This includes but is not limited to drawings, models, and
    manipulatives, allowing for critical thinking and a deeper
    understanding.

-   Does the SYL item have multiple entry points, allowing for students
    to share their initial thinking and strategies in various ways?

-   Does the SYL item build upon student's current understanding,
    allowing students to address any previous unfinished learning and
    bridge content between topics?

-   Is the SYL item context high interest, yet appropriate to the grade
    level of students, including interesting and relatable mathematical
    context, to aid in student engagement, understanding, and
    transferability?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Is the SYL item context thoughtful to students of all backgrounds?

    -   Does the SYL item lend itself to a rich follow-up discussion to
        set up students to be accountable for explaining their
        strategies?

    -   Confirm the SYL item does not introduce new formal vocabulary.

    -   If applicable, condense the SYL into a single paragraph. The
        entire V2 SYL Item will be above the student workspace. There
        will be no write on lines or questions below the student
        workspace.

    -   All V2 question stems will be "Show your thinking". If the
        developer wants to incorporate the existing V1 question stem, it
        needs to be worked into the V2 item.

> EMM.

3b) Review the V1 Common Error and Strategy: Review the V1 SYL Common
Error and Strategy which can be found on the Spark Your Learning Student
Sample Page. The SYL should be used first and foremost to elicit common
errors of the focus standard if possible. Use your best judgement to
ensure the common error and strategy match the SYL item and any edits
that have been made to the item. Make edits to the V1 common error and
strategy as needed based on any change made to the SYL item. Choose one
common strategy to highlight in the spark discussion chart. If a new
common error needs to be identified for the V2 lesson once edits have
been made to the SYL item, use the instructions in step 5b and 5e and
the [[Common Error
Spreadsheet](https://hmhco.box.com/s/agiw7aix9amx5h0q8nw66eerhf9c96ou).]{.mark}

3c) Evaluate the V1 SYL Turn and Talk: The grades K-2 V1 SYL Turn and
Talk can be found in the TE in the right-hand column of the persevere
section of the SYL page. The grades 3-8 V1 SYL Turn and Talk can be
found in the SE on the student SYL page.

To evaluate the V1 SYL Turn and Talk for V2 criteria ask the following
questions about the SYL turn and talk question:

-   Does the turn and talk question match any edits made to the SYL
    task?

-   Is this question a follow-up question to the SYL extending the task?

-   Can the question be connected to the common error identified for the
    SYL?

-   Does this question set up the expectation and support for students
    to be accountable for explaining their strategies?

> Make any necessary changes to the V1 SYL turn and talk to align with
> the V2 criteria given above.

3d) Lesson Materials: Make note of the lesson materials listed for the
lesson in V1 on TE Before You Teach Page in the lesson focus and
coherence section. Make note of the existing V1 SYL Show Your Thinking
Icons. Make sure any edits made to the V1 SYL item still match the
lesson materials. The lesson materials will be recorded in a later step.

**Now, move to step 6 to place the above components in the EMM and
author new scripting.**

### Step 4: Evaluating and Editing the V1 Components of an A1 SYL 

In this step you will locate and review all the V1 SYL components of the
A1 source lesson in the V1 Teacher Edition. The source lesson is
identified in the [A1 Table of
Contents](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1352447354127?s=la4w92nseqozdragpx5tbo8iytwjixjn)
column C. The SYL developer will be evaluating the existing V1 SYL item,
turn and talk, common error, and common strategy, to determine if these
existing SYL components can be reused with edits and new scripting in
V2. The developer will need the Teacher Edition of the V1 source lesson,
the SYL Classroom Presentation Tools, along with the [A1 New and Revised
Lesson
Document](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1500819659345?s=i36y6mdwu8tv4g6nozw4i56k246opabf)
and the [A1 Table of
Contents.](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1352447354127?s=la4w92nseqozdragpx5tbo8iytwjixjn)

4a) Review, Evaluate and Condense the V1 A1 SYL Item: The V1 Algebra 1
SYL has a different format than grades K-8. The first step to condensing
and evaluating the Algebra 1 V1 SYL is to review the SYL item in its
entirety. This includes the SYL on the SE SYL page and the corresponding
Spark You Learning Classroom Presentation Tool located in the lesson
resources on ED. The SYL should be condensed into one single paragraph,
with one focus question. All information students need to solve should
be contained in the paragraph. In addition to the reformatting of the V1
SYL, the SYL needs to meet the following V2 criteria:

-   The SYL item elicits the common errors identified for this lesson
    and align to a lesson focus standard.

-   The context of the SYL item is culturally sensitive, keeping in mind
    the background of all students.

-   The SYL is projected to take students about 15 minutes to complete.

-   The SYL item is solvable using multiple strategies and approaches.
    This includes but is not limited to drawings, models, and
    manipulatives, allowing for critical thinking and a deeper
    understanding.

-   The SYL item has multiple entry points, allowing for students to
    share their initial thinking and strategies in various ways.

-   The SYL item builds upon student's current understanding, allowing
    students to address any previous unfinished learning and bridge
    content between topics.

-   The SYL item context is high interest, yet appropriate to the grade
    level of students, including interesting and relatable mathematical
    context, to aid in student engagement, understanding, and
    transferability.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The SYL item context is thoughtful to students of all backgrounds.

    -   The SYL item lends itself to a rich follow-up discussion to set
        up students to be accountable for explaining their strategies.

    -   The SYL item does not introduce new formal vocabulary.

    -   The entire V2 SYL item will be above the student workspace.
        There will be no write on lines or questions below the student
        workspace.

    -   The question stem is "Show your thinking".

> Reformat the existing A1 SYL and make any necessary edits to the V1 A1
> SYL item to align with the V2 criteria given above. Refer to [DEI

4b) Review the Algebra 1 V1 Common Error and Strategy: Review the V1 SYL
Common Error and Strategy which can be found on the Spark Your Learning
Student Sample Page. The SYL should be used first and foremost to elicit
common errors of the focus standard if possible. Use your best judgement
to ensure the common error and strategy match the SYL item and any edits
that have been made to the item. Make edits to the V1 common error and
strategy as needed. Choose one common strategy to highlight in the spark
discussion chart. If a new common error needs to be identified for the
V2 lesson once edits have been made to the SYL item, use the
instructions in step 5b and 5e and the [[Common Error
Spreadsheet](https://hmhco.box.com/s/agiw7aix9amx5h0q8nw66eerhf9c96ou).]{.mark}

4c) Evaluate the Algebra 1 V1 SYL Turn and Talk: The A1 V1 SYL Turn and
Talk can be found in the SE on the student SYL page. The A1 Turn and
Talk will also need to be condensed into a single focus question format
rather than multiple parts.

Condense and evaluate the V1 SYL Turn and Talk for V2 criteria ask the
following questions about the SYL turn and talk question:

-   Does the turn and talk question match any edits made to the SYL
    task?

-   Is this question a follow-up question to the SYL extending the task?

-   Can the question be connected to the common error identified for the
    SYL?

-   Does this question set up the expectation and support for students
    to be accountable for explaining their strategies?

> Make any necessary changes to the V1 SYL turn and talk to align with
> the V2 criteria given above.

4d) Lesson Materials: Make note of the lesson materials listed for the
lesson in V1 on TE Before You Teach Page in the lesson focus and
coherence section. Make note of the existing V1 SYL Show Your Thinking
Icons. Make sure any edits made to the V1 SYL item still match the
lesson materials. The lesson materials will be recorded in a later step.

**Now, move to step 6 to place the above components in the EMM and
author new scripting.**

### Step 5: Authoring a New SYL from Scratch 

When authoring a new SYL refer to the specific grade level [Table of
Contents](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci) to
review the lesson placement in the module along with the New & Revised
Lesson Document. Reference column D to determine if the lesson is a REV
or a NEW lesson for V2.

-   If the lesson is a REV (revised) lesson, review the V1 source
    lesson/lessons including the lesson objectives. Also review the
    grade level New & Revised Lesson document that can be found in the
    grade level TOC folder, on any notes and changes.

-   If the lesson is a new lesson being created, review the grade level
    New & Revised Lesson document about the new lesson being created.

Some of the steps below may be outlined in the New and Revised Lesson
Document. Make sure to check this document before moving to Step 5a.

5a) Lesson Focus Standards: After reviewing the lesson placement and any
New & Revised Lesson Document notes, identify and review the lesson
Focus standards to select the best standard to align the SYL item too.
The SYL should be used first and foremost to elicit common errors of the
focus standard if possible.

-   When at least one of the lesson Focus standards have been addressed
    previously in the module, or in a prior module as a **Focus**
    standard, that focus standard should be chosen to align the new SYL
    item to. If more than one focus standard is addressed previously in
    the module or in a previous module, pick the standard that best
    serves as a set-up for the lesson, based on the lesson objectives.

-   If the lesson Focus standards have not been previously addressed in
    the current module, or a previous module as a Focus standard, but
    the standard has been covered as an introduction standard, that
    standard should be chosen to align the SYL to. Refer to the lesson
    objectives of the lesson the standard is introduced in and the
    lesson objectives of the lesson you are authoring for to guide the
    SYL item.

-   If a Focus standard of the lesson has NOT been previously covered in
    the module, or a previous module as an introduction or Focus
    standard, reference the [Common Core Coherence
    Guide](https://tools.achievethecore.org/coherence-map/), to
    determine which prerequisite standard maps into the Focus standard.
    Chose a standard that best serves as a set-up for the lesson.

-   If the Focus standard of the lesson repeats in multiple lessons
    throughout the module, this standard should be chosen to align the
    SYL item to. Use the lesson objectives of the previous and current
    lesson to help guide the SYL item in these cases.

5b) Common Error Look-Up: Once a standard has been chosen to align the
SYL to, review all common errors for the SYL standard using the [[Common
Error
Spreadsheet]{.mark}](https://hmhco.box.com/s/agiw7aix9amx5h0q8nw66eerhf9c96ou).
Keep these errors in mind as you author the SYL item. Choose one common
error that will be highlighted in the spark discussions chart.

5c) Author the SYL Item: Author an SYL item that aligns to the standard
identified in step 5a. Following the criteria below when authoring a new
task. Also refer to [DEI
Guidelines](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1518850590773?s=1pzlyh15hh2qj7y6butm903ybil7f287)
for further guidance on appropriate context.

-   The SYL item should elicit the common errors identified.

-   The estimated time of completion for an entire lesson is 45 minutes.
    The SYL should take students and teacher an appropriate amount of
    time to complete from the start of the SYL to the conclusion of the
    Turn and Talk. SYL time suggestions per grade band are:

    -   K-2: 5-10 minutes

    -   3-5: 10-15 minutes

    -   6-A1: About 15 minutes

-   The SYL item should be solvable using multiple strategies and
    approaches, including drawings, models, realia, and manipulatives,
    to allow for critical thinking and a deeper understanding.

-   The SYL item should have multiple entry points, allowing for
    students to share their initial thinking and strategies in various
    ways.

-   The SYL item should be built upon student's current understanding,
    allowing students to address any previous unfinished learning and
    bridge content between topics.

-   The SYL item should be of high interest to students, including
    interesting and relatable mathematical context, to aide in student
    engagement, understanding, and transferability.

-   The SYL item should lend itself to a rich follow-up discussion with
    follow-up questions to set up students to be accountable for
    explaining their strategies.

-   The SYL item should be about a grade level appropriate context. Ex)
    Avoid asking kindergarteners about screen time, per the latest
    research pointing to less screen time for younger children.

-   The SYL item context should be thoughtful to students of all
    backgrounds. Think about the diverse background of all students when
    choosing a context. Not all students live in a house being
    remodeled. Avoid problems around calories. Build appropriate
    thoughtful context around STEAM concepts. Ex) Measurement, length,
    temperature, data collection, building things, rainfall, plants, and
    animals.

-   The SYL item should not formally introduce new vocabulary so that
    the teacher can attend to students' mathematical ideas rather than
    correcting new vocabulary.

-   If possible, the SYL item should be an open-ended task, that has
    more than one solution. The task should be accessible by all
    students, yet that extends to sufficient depth that all students
    remain challenged (a high ceiling low floor threshold).

    -   The SYL Item should end with the question stem "Show your
        thinking".

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Find the solution or one possible solution to the SYL item.

#####  

5d) Write the Common Strategy: Author a common strategy based on the SYL
created. The common strategy is a sample of a student solving the SYL
correctly with an appropriate grade level skill or tool. The common
strategy should include any corresponding images and a verbal
description of the strategy. Author should provide scrap art for any
images or models.

5e) Adapt the Common Error: Adapt the common error chosen in 5b in terms
of the SYL item authored. The common error should include a student
sample where the common error is being made. Images can be shown with
the common error. Author should provide scrap art for the image needed.

5f) Confirm Lesson Materials: Confirm that the SYL item authored can be
solved using the lesson materials listed on the TE Before You Teach Page
and the Module Lesson Map Page. Determine Show Your Thinking Icons based
on the lesson materials, and tool that would be helpful to solving the
SYL.

5g) Author the SYL Turn and Talk: Author an SYL turn and talk question.
The SYL turn and talk question should be a follow-up question to the SYL
that extends the task and connects to the common error. The turn and
talk question should also set up the expectation and support for
students to be accountable for explaining their strategies. The turn and
talk should be an appropriate grade level reading level and word count.

**Now, move to step 6 to place the above components in the EMM and
author new scripting.**

### Step 6: Placing Spark Your Learning Components and Authoring New Scripting in the EMM: 

6a) Placing the Lesson Materials from step 3d, 4d or 5f:

-   Find the **Spark Your Learning (Whole-Class Session: Learn)** table
    of the EMM. Fill in the Suggested materials for workspace based on
    step 3d, 4d, or 5f, which is based on the lesson materials listed on
    the TE Before You Teach Page, the Module Lesson Map Page, and the
    existing Show Your Thinking Icons. View the grade level Show Your
    Thinking Document for the appropriate grade level to view the V2
    icons.

    -   [Gr K Show your Thinking
        Icons](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1580359055665)

    -   [G 1-2 Show Your Thinking
        Icons](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1580362093354)

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
    -   [Gr 3-5 SE Show your Thinking
        Icons](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1512121870888)

    -   [Gr 6-A1 Show your Thinking
        Icons](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1525514526546)

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
    -   Find the file name from the grade level Show your Thinking Icons
        Documents linked above, of the show your thinking icons to be
        included in the SYL.

-   Paste the file names of the Show Your Thinking Icons from the
    document into the EMM **Spark Your Learning (Whole-Class Session:
    Learn)** suggested materials for workspace.

-   Determine the grouping students will participate in when completing
    the spark. This grouping can be determined by the amount of
    materials available. Sparks are typically done in pairs or small
    groups. If enough materials are available from the K-8 Kit for
    materials and the content allows, students should work in pairs.

6b) Placing the Spark Your Learning Item & Image:

-   Copy the Spark Your Learning Item from step 3a, 4a, or 5c.

-   Find the **Spark Your Learning (Whole-Class Session: Learn)**
    section of the EMM. Paste the SYL Item from step 3a, 4a, or 5c into
    the Student Content (Print & Digital) TE Student View (Print)
    paragraph box as the paragraph text. Include a screenshot of any SYL
    images in the image box. Note that in Plankton (Grades K-2), the
    block type is referred to as *text* instead of *paragraph.*

    -   [The **digital** pattern/block type has been predetermined and
        is boilerplate within the EMM.]{.mark}

    -   [GK: Text, Drawing Interaction (image will be set in the
        background of Drawing Interaction)]{.mark}

    -   [G1-2: Text, Image (if applicable), Drawing Interaction]{.mark}

    -   [G3-A1: Paragraph, Image (if applicable), Drawing
        Interaction]{.mark}

    -   [The EMM has an additional section in the pink left-hand column
        for how the content will appear in print. This has also been
        predetermined. The content will appear as **open space** in
        print.]{.mark}

> ![](media/image14.png){width="4.18215769903762in"
> height="2.7968733595800526in"}

-   Find the **Spark Your Learning Turn and Talk** section of the EMM.
    Paste the SYL Item from step 3a, 4a or 5c into the Student
    Content/Student View (TE) paragraph box as the paragraph text.
    Include a screenshot of any SYL images in the image box.

    -   [The digital interaction will be **Speech Text** for the
        T&T]{.mark}

    -   [The print content will be set to an **open space**]{.mark}
        ![](media/image15.png){width="3.200758967629046in"
        height="3.2263648293963256in"}

-   Find the **Review** **Spark Your Learning (Whole-Class Session:
    Learn)** section of the EMM. Paste the SYL Item from step 3a , 4a,
    or 5c into the Student Content (Print/Digital) Student View (TE)
    paragraph box as the paragraph text. Include a screenshot of any SYL
    images in the image box.

6c) Determine if Three Reads routine applies to the SYL & Write
Scripting:

-   Determine if the Three Reads MLR routine is appropriate for the SYL
    item. Review the [MLR
    Guidelines](https://hmhco.box.com/s/nsnr12yr47fnm1fxxyyebx1241wmvdsz)
    for more information on the Three Reads routine.

    -   If the Three Reads routine applies, find the **Get Ready, Learn,
        Assess** Table in the Before You Teach section of the EMM and
        fill in Three Reads where it states \[insert MLR\]. Then find
        the **Spark Your Learning (Whole-Class Session: Learn)** section
        of the EMM. In the TE Teacher Notes (Print and Classcraft) fill
        in the \[text\] section of the given Three Reads routine. View
        the [MLR
        Guidelines](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1514408056057?s=nsnr12yr47fnm1fxxyyebx1241wmvdsz)
        for additional guidance on this text.

    -   If the Three Reads routine does NOT apply for the SYL item, no
        MLR will be used. Find the **Get Ready, Learn, Assess** Table in
        the Before You Teach section of the EMM and delete the \[insert
        MLR\] bracket. Then find the **Spark Your Learning (Whole-Class
        Session: Learn)** section of the EMM. Delete the Three Reads
        routine text (shown in the red box on the screenshot below).
        These lines of text should be replaced with:

        -   "**Now**, have students read the problem. Make sure they
            understand what the problem is asking them to do."

![](media/image16.png){width="4.062972440944882in"
height="2.04962489063867in"}

6d) Placing the Spark Discussions Chart Components & Write Scripting:

-   Find the **Spark Discussions** (*TE Only*) section of EMM. This
    chart addresses the common error and the common strategy for the
    specific SYL, using the common error from step 3b, 4b or 5e. The
    Spark Discussions Chart has a narrative overview section, an
    Addressing Commons Errors Section, and a Deepen Student Thinking
    Section.

-   The first section of the Spark Discussions Chart is a narrative
    overview of the common error for the SYL. We are not prescribing
    strategies to solve in this narrative. Place the narrative text in
    the 2^nd^ row, under Spark Discussions. Th narrative should be 1-3
    sentences elaborating on the error and any helpful professional
    development for teachers. We are not including strategies in this
    section.

-   Paste the common error from step 3b, 4b or 5e in the **Addressing
    Common Error** section of the Spark Discussions chart. Use the
    boilerplate sentence: "Students \[might/may\] \[insert text\]. Use
    the scripting to provide support for this error.

-   Include a screen shot of any images in the scrap bracket.

-   Author teacher scripting around the common error helping students
    understand and correct the error for further learning. This
    scripting should indicate exactly how a teacher could intervene when
    a common error occurs, while highlighting the common error. Include
    this text in the **Addressing Common Error** **Scripting** portion
    of the table.

-   Paste the strategy from step 3b, 4b or 5d in the **Deepen Student
    Thinking** section of the Spark Discussions chart. Use the
    boilerplate text:

    -   "If students \[Insert text\] correctly, then use the scripting
        to help students explain their thinking."

> Include a screen shot of any images in the scrap bracket.

-   Author teacher scripting around the strategy and how students solved
    correctly and avoided making the common error. Share examples of
    what acceptable and encouraged strategies might look like that still
    highlight the common error. Include this text in the **Deepen
    Student Thinking Scripting** portion of the table.

6e) Placing the Turn and Talk & Write Scripting:

-   Find the **Spark Your Learning Turn and Talk** section of EMM. Paste
    the Turn and Talk question from step 3c, 4c, or 5g in the drawing
    interaction of the table as the question stem. Include a possible
    answer in pink font under the turn and talk question.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Author **Teacher Notes (TE)** around the SYL Turn and Talk. Use the
    boilerplate text: **"Finally,** have students complete the **Turn &
    Talk** routine.

> **\[**Insert text\]\"

6f) Authoring SYL ML Teacher Strategy:

-   Find the **Teaching Strategy Multilingual Learners** section of EMM
    after the SYL Turn and Talk.

-   Reference the [ML
    guidelines](https://hmhco.box.com/s/evov74b0iyoqbf3hw6rljzm79vpz19s9)
    for guidance to write this ML Teacher Strategy.

-   Find the **Review Spark Your Learning (Whole-Class Session: Learn)**
    section of the EMM.

-   In the Speech Text box author a specific unique Review Spark Your
    Learning question stem.

    -   Note that in Plankton (Grades K-2), the unique Review Spark Your
        Learning "question stem" belongs in a ***text*** Plankton Block
        Type. It does *not* belong in the Speech Text box for this grade
        band, although the Speech Text row should still be indicated on
        the EMM. It can be left as is with the predetermined Response
        Validation and Feedback sections set as N/A.

-   The Review Spark Your Learning question stem should draw on some
    aspect of the lesson's common error, new learning, interesting
    discovery, or math efficiency. The question stem should ensure the
    understanding from the SYL has been addressed and any learning gaps
    are closed. This question stem should be unique for each lesson.

-   In the Teacher Notes (TE) box author teacher facing language in the
    ASK format that will help the teacher guide the students through the
    Review Spark Your Learning question stem. This language should help
    teachers scaffold through the review spark your learning question
    stem. Sample Review Spark Your Learning question stems have been
    given in the table.

## ** **Tasks

**Introduction**

-   The Instructional Tasks serve as guided practice learning
    opportunities where students engage with the concepts and skills
    taught within the lesson.

-   The purpose of the instructional tasks is to provide students with
    stepped out practice opportunities that support students in moving
    toward independent application of the lesson objective.

-   The Instructional Tasks will need to be placed within the respective
    sections of the Lesson Level EMM:

    -   [Setting Up Tasks & Placing
        Content](#setting-up-tasks-placing-content) (Whole-Class
        Session: Learn)

        -   Plankton Block Types/Patterns

        -   Student Content

        -   Teacher Notes

    -   [Teaching Strategy for Tasks](#_Teaching_Strategy_for)

    -   [Turn & Talk](#_Turn_&_Talk)

    -   [Teaching Strategy for Turn & Talk](#_Teaching_Strategy_for_1)

    -   [Depth of Knowledge](#_Depth_of_Knowledge)

    -   [Continuing with Task 2 and Beyond](#_Continuing_with_Tasks)

-   Any text preexisting on the EMM in the Task section can be
    considered boilerplate. Any content that needs to be inserted or
    changed around the boilerplate will appear inside of brackets.

### Reuse, Revise, or New?

-   Determine if content can be reused from V1 (Reused Content), reused
    from V1 with edits (Revised Content) or new content that needs to be
    written from scratch (New Content).

    -   Instructional Tasks will either be reused from a source lesson
        in NLv1, or in cases where the task has been revised or is
        entirely new, you will need to reference the [LXDV
        notes](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)
        for that specific grade (Word Document).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   If an Instructional Task needs to be created, please refer to the
    [LXDV
    notes](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci) for
    that specific lesson and use the Justification tab from the [Table
    of
    Contents](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)
    to ensure that necessary content is included.

    -   To determine whether or not the Instructional Task is reused,
        revised, or new, refer to Column D in the specific grade level
        [Table of
        Contents](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)
        (Excel Sheet).

-   Highlighted cells indicate that something in that lesson has been
    modified, and you can find more information on those Instructional
    Tasks using the [LXDV
    notes](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)[.]{.underline}

**Finding Reused Content**

-   Lessons that have Instructional Tasks that are reused will be marked
    as "PU" (pick-up) in Column D in the [Table of
    Contents](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)
    and will not be highlighted.

-   Column C will list a source lesson.

    -   Navigate to the source lesson listed in the TOC by using the v1
        [Into Math National
        TEs.](https://hmhco.box.com/s/qpknzvk75o7vmc6lbqx8p1tgcyg0ikzq)

    -   Task 1 will start on the second page if there is a Spark Your
        Learning. If there is no Spark Your Learning, Task 1 will start
        on the first page.

    -   All tasks from the source lesson should be included unless
        otherwise indicated in the [LXDV
        notes](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)[.]{.underline}

    -   There are some grade level considerations listed below regarding
        reused Instructional Tasks:

-   Please note that some tasks that are being reused may still need to
    be revised so that there is a parity with print. More information
    below in the **Student Content** section.

-   Tasks that are being reused may also need to be revised or replaced
    due to CEID and/or California Environmental concerns.

        Guidelines](https://hmhco.box.com/s/roax1vvd7xetl7jq6u7k2ms31owfpapj)
        for guidance on whether a task needs to be revised or replaced.

-   Each task will have its own table within the EMM. There are several
    task sections (4 sections or 6 sections depending on grade level)
    preset within the EMM, but some lessons will not require all of the
    task sections due to a lower amount of tasks. Please DO NOT DELETE
    the additional task sections that you do not use. Please insert N/A
    into the unused task boxes.

-   Depending on the grade, one task may have several lettered parts (A,
    B, C, D, etc.) Each part should have its own row and pattern in the
    EMM. (see Grade Level Considerations below.)

-   Information for the Instructional Task section of the EMM will come
    from both the student page in the v1 TE, as well as the teacher
    wrap.

**Finding Revised Content**

-   When the [Table of
    Contents](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)
    indicates a lesson requires content revision, Column D will indicate
    "REV" or "COMB" (revised, combined) and Column C will indicate the
    source lesson(s) to be revised from NLv1 or another HMH source.

    -   If content is revised from v1, you will need to reference the
        [Into Math National
        TEs.](https://hmhco.box.com/s/qpknzvk75o7vmc6lbqx8p1tgcyg0ikzq)

    -   If content is revised from another HMH source, that source will
        be linked for you within the Table of Contents.

-   Task information regarding specific revisions can be found in the
    [LXDV
    notes](https://hmhco.app.box.com/folder/232533016263?s=x7zvv2ucfrjsvtc82ucw1curdqf37348).
    LXDV notes may also reference another lesson from which content may
    be adopted in order to revise the indicated lesson.

**Finding or Authoring New Content**

-   When the [Table of
    Contents](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)
    indicates a lesson requires new content, Column D will indicate
    "NEW."

-   Refer to the grade level [LXDV
    notes](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci) to
    determine what content standards the newly authored lesson will need
    to target. Some of the new lesson tasks have been previously
    authored into the LXDV notes. At other times in the LXDV notes,
    specific references are made to what needs to be included in the
    newly authored lesson.

### Setting Up Tasks & Placing Content

-   Find the **Whole-Class Session: Learn** section in the EMM. This
    entire first section is dedicated to Task 1.

-   Use the SE Bookmap tab of the grade level
    [TOC](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci) for
    page number to fill in the page number.

-   The next section of the EMM is broken down into three columns:

> **1.** Plankton Block Type/Pattern [(with Print Content)]{.mark}
>
> **2.** Student Content
>
> **3.** Teacher Content

-   

**Plankton Block Type/Pattern:** The first column in the table indicates
the type of Plankton Block Type/pattern that will be needed for digital
authoring. Use the [[Pattern Guide for SYL and Tasks EMM
Development](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1523366055710?s=f8zkt8htnd6if5axdxvz9bo6yaoumfws)
and the standards in the grade level
[TOC](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci) to
determine the type of block type/pattern used for each part of an
individual Instructional
Task.](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1523366055710?s=f8zkt8htnd6if5axdxvz9bo6yaoumfws)

[**Student Content:** The second column in the table includes lesson
content for both print and digital. The actual lesson content is the
same for both modes, but digital-specific considerations are included
here. Gray text refers to digital-specific considerations and require
you to input information needed within the Plankton Block Type/pattern
when necessary. You can find the input fields for each pattern in the
[Pattern Guide for SYL and Tasks EMM
Development.](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1523366055710?s=f8zkt8htnd6if5axdxvz9bo6yaoumfws)
Black text is student facing text which will appear both on the digital
activity as well as the print Student Edition. The **Plankton Block

[**Teacher Guide:** The third column in the table includes teacher notes
specific to the lesson. **Parts of the Task Teacher Guide:**
ConsiderStartAskNow NextThen**Key:**Purple -- must occur in this order
Green -- can be moved in the flow to where it makes sense in the
teachers supporting the students through the task. But all 5 pieces of
the structure must be present for every task. Blue -- only occurs when
an SMP / MP is being cited for that task.**How to author the Parts of
the Task Teacher Notes Text:**Black roman text is boilerplate and must
be used. Text in \[brackets\] indicate where content needs to be
inserted by LXDv. Keep the formatting as shown, so if text is bold, it
should be bold in the EMM as well; if text is magenta, it should be
magenta in the EMM as well.Text in (parenthesis) is directions for the
LXDv to populate the
EMM.](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1523366055710?s=f8zkt8htnd6if5axdxvz9bo6yaoumfws)

vocabulary. If the task is not in introducing new vocabulary, this
should not appear in the Teacher Guide and the Teacher Guide content
should start with the **Start** part. Delete 'and \[Vocabulary Term\]'
if needed, or add an additional \[Vocabulary Term\] if needed, using the
oxford comma.Vocabulary Terms should have the same treatment as in the
SE, so should be bold and highlighted in yellow.(This part consists
mostly of boilerplate. Insert the vocabulary terms where the brackets
occur. These should be the same vocabulary terms for this task on the SE
page.)](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1523366055710?s=f8zkt8htnd6if5axdxvz9bo6yaoumfws)

both.)](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1523366055710?s=f8zkt8htnd6if5axdxvz9bo6yaoumfws)

[**Notes on Ask and Now order**For placing the Ask and Now in the
Teacher Notes content, base this on the task and the supporting teacher
questions and determine when the teachers should ask questions in the
flow of solving the task. This applies to questions from V1 re-used
content and for newly written content. There are three options for the
order of Ask and Now: Note, Next might be interspersed with Ask and Now,
depending on where the SMP/MP makes the most sense for that
task.](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1523366055710?s=f8zkt8htnd6if5axdxvz9bo6yaoumfws)

[At least one Instructional Task will need to include a Common Error in
the Teaching Strategy section following the task. The common error can
focus on a practical error that students may make while solving the
task. The minimum number of common error task teaching supports for each
lesson is as followed: Lessons with 2-4 tasks, should have at least 1
common error support. Lessons with 5 or more tasks, should have at least
2 common error supports. **The Common Error Supports can only occur
after a task, not within a task turn and talk.** The Common Error Task
Teaching Support connects the lesson task to a unique common error for
the lesson standards found in the TOC. The common error identified in
the Common Error Teaching Support is different from the common error
identified in the SYL. The goal of the common error teaching support is
to provide common error support for student work and to provide
professional development for teachers. Common Error Teaching Support
expands the content understanding with as wide a range of support as
possible.Review the Standards: Before authoring a Common Error Teaching
Support refer to the specific grade level [Table of
Contents](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci) to
review the lesson standards. After identifying the lesson standards,
review all common errors that have been identified for the standard
using the [[Common Error
Spreadsheet](https://hmhco.box.com/s/agiw7aix9amx5h0q8nw66eerhf9c96ou).]{.mark}
Choose a Common Error: Choose a unique common error from the tracker,
that has NOT been previously used in the specific lesson. The SYL Common
Error from earlier in the lesson cannot be reused, and every common
error support in a lesson must highlight a unique common error. The
common error can repeat from another lesson, but let's minimize this to
not overuse the same common error throughout the module. You will need
to edit the common error content from the [spreadsheet]{.mark} to best
fit and meet the needs of a task. The common error is NOT directly
picked up from the [spreadsheet]{.mark}. The [spreadsheet]{.mark} is a
reference point, to model the support around. Author the Common Error
Support: The Common Error Teaching Support can be authored: in a Q&A or
narrative stylehave a sample question and then a sample answer The
important thing is that the style addresses the common error students
may be making. The common error addresses what students are doing
incorrectly and the teaching support addresses what we need to
understand to support them once a common error is detected.The Common
Error Teaching Support MUST BE UNIQUE FOR THE TASK. Nothing can be
verbatim or directly picked and used from the [[common error
spreadsheet](https://hmhco.box.com/s/agiw7aix9amx5h0q8nw66eerhf9c96ou).]{.mark}
Common Error Teaching Supports must start with the boilerplate text:
"Students \[might/may\] \[insert text\]. Once authored, find the
Teaching Strategy \[Icon\] box for the specific task which you will be
incorporating a Common Error Teaching Support. Teaching Strategy
\[Icon\] box is found after every Task (Whole-Class Session: Learn) in
the EMM. In the Run-in head section fill-in "Common Error". Fill in the
text you authored from the steps above in the \[text\] section. Repeat
this process for each Common Error Task Teaching Support needed to meet
the minimum
requirements.](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1523366055710?s=f8zkt8htnd6if5axdxvz9bo6yaoumfws)

[There is a minimum of 2 UDLs per lesson within the tasks. You can add
multiple teaching strategies to a task to ensure the correct amount is
present within a
lesson.](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1523366055710?s=f8zkt8htnd6if5axdxvz9bo6yaoumfws)

[**Plankton**For Turn and Talks, the speech to text pattern will be the
one that is commonly used. In Plankton, the question will need to exist
within a *text* block type in its own row. In G3--A1, the question will
exist within the *question stem* section in the Speech to Text
pattern.![](media/image35.png){width="2.909400699912511in"

[**Student Content**To introduce the Turn and Talk, the original Task
question (from the paragraph pattern) should be presented in the first
row. This also includes any images that were found in v1, alt text which
needs to be written for those images, Print Spec ID and the Digital Spec
ID. Gray template text indicates digital or print specific needs.If the
image picked up from the original task has an image with anno, the anno
needs to be turned to black text for students to reference. Make a note
in the EMM to change anno to black.The second row of the table
introduces the Turn and Talk question. For lessons that are being picked
up, the Turn and Talk can be found at the bottom of the SE page below
the corresponding task (see Grade Level Considerations below.) If the
content is revised/new, please pick up the Turn and Talk from the [*LXDV
notes*](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci) for
that specific lesson.The Turn and Talk question will be placed in the
Question Stem. Anno will be used for print

[Start by re-reading the purpose of the lesson.Use the [Into Math v1
TE.pdf](https://hmhco.app.box.com/folder/256767607193?s=qpknzvk75o7vmc6lbqx8p1tgcyg0ikzq)
to view the v1 aligned standards, I can statement, and instructional
tasks for the lesson.Read through the
[EMM.docx](https://hmhco.app.box.com/folder/265959004719) to take note
of any updates to the standards, I Can statement, or instructional
tasks.**Standards** Make sure you understand exactly which part(s) of
the standard(s) this lesson primarily focuses on as well as introduces
or applies (changes from v1 will be shown in the
[IM_CA_G#\_TOC.xlsx](https://hmhco.app.box.com/folder/265959339929?s=wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)
and the [IM_CA_G#\_New & Revised
Lessons.docx](https://hmhco.app.box.com/folder/265959339929?s=wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci)
as well).**I Can Statement** Understand this statement in tandem with
the standards. Practice items in the lesson should reference some aspect
of this statement.**Instructional Tasks** Read and understand the steps
of each task, taking special note of not only what is being asked, but
how it is being asked, how the student is expected to respond, and the
extent to which the student is taught the concepts or skills. Practice
items in the lesson should mirror these aspects of the instructional
tasks they follow.Use the [Manually Scored Items by Standard &
Lesson.xlsx](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1513503808407?s=mmdx7ad2x184wt7g6msyupz50xldiexs)
to decide if this lesson's truncated standards (listed on the Before You
Teach section of the
[EMM.docx](https://hmhco.app.box.com/folder/265959004719)) require a
drawing/modeling interaction, an explain/justify interaction, or a
choice of how to represent their thinking interaction (these are
manually scored questions).**Rule 1** Consider how you can assess the
standard with an auto scorable interaction using the [Math Item Specs
Guide.pdf](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1513509263529?s=70y9ae14x633kw77fz86o3gm1qxrf2fm)
(see *Use Cases* and *Scoring*).**Rule 2** The *Practice On Your Own*
component for a lesson can contain one (1) manually scored question. Use
the [Manually Scored Items by Standard &
lesson.xlsx](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1513503808407?s=mmdx7ad2x184wt7g6msyupz50xldiexs)
to decide if this lesson's standards require a manually scored question
in tandem with the [Math Item Specs
Guide.pdf](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1513509263529?s=70y9ae14x633kw77fz86o3gm1qxrf2fm)
(see *Use Cases* and *Scoring*).Notice how much space in on the page the
current versions of the items in v1 occupy. Flag items in the component
which could be removed (and allow for the remaining items to still cover
the breadth and depth of the lesson's instruction) in case items need to
be discarded later to save space.Ensure that the remaining, unflagged
items will fully cover the concepts and skills introduced, focused on,
and applied in the lesson's tasks and aligned standards if cuts are
made.Build out the table on your EMM pages to match the number of items
in this section currently in the v1 source lesson.Input the item \#
shared by print and digital in the first column (multi-part items should
use the item \# for a paragraph stem and then the item number plus a
letter a, b, c, etc. for each part)**Rule** Please restart numbering at
1 with *Practice On Your Own* section. You will notice that the
numbering for *On Your Own* in v1 continued from the last numbered item
in the *Check
Understanding*.](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1523366055710?s=f8zkt8htnd6if5axdxvz9bo6yaoumfws)

[Complete the orange "Module Planning Pages" section by filling out the
following information:California Page Only -- Content ConnectionsEnter
the Content Connections (CCs) for the module from Column B of the
grade-level [Table of
Contents](https://hmhco.box.com/s/wtdm99xjf3omi9ixmf3a0eekwbexq9ci). If
the module has more than one CC, list each CC on a separate line.What
will students learn in this module? National Page**This Module:** The
first cell in the row for "This Module" says\
"In this module, as students \[refer to focus of module/title\], they
will:". Replace the bracketed text with the main focus of the module,
e.g., "In this module, as students divide by one-digit numbers, they
will:". In the second cell, enter the [Key
Topics](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1591987640667) for the module as
a bulleted list, with each Key Topic starting with a lowercase word and
ending with a period.[The Module Opener for the *first* lesson in the
grade will need to refer to the previous grade for the key topics. Use
the image is from the last module of the previous grade, but those Key
Topics may not have anything to do with the first module in the current
grade, so list the Key Topics that are the most important topics from
the previous grade. Labeling would be: **In Grade \[x\] you learned how
to. . . **]{.mark}**Prior Learning:** Enter a bulleted list of skills
(first word lowercase, ending with a period) that are related to the
module's Key Topics but that students learned in previous modules or in
previous grades of IM v2. The Prior Learning column of the Mathematical
Progressions charts for the source modules in the v1 TE (see example
below) may be a good resource here. However, the LXDV should verify that
each skill in this column was actually taught prior to the current v2
module (which may not be the case due to resequencing or omitting some
v1 modules and lessons).\
![](media/image40.png){width="4.75in" height="1.6770833333333333in"}\
The [Coherence Maps](https://tools.achievethecore.org/coherence-map/)
from Achieve the Core may also be useful since they relate standards
covered in the current grade to similar standards covered in prior
grades (or in some cases to standards that may have been covered earlier
in the current grade).**Future Connections:** Enter a bulleted list of
skills (first word lowercase, ending with a period) that are related to
the module's Key Topics but that students will learn in later modules or
in later grades of IM v2. As with the Prior Learning section, the
Mathematical Progressions charts for the source modules in the v1 TE and
the Coherence Maps from Achieve the Core are good resources for
generating these skills.What will students learn in this module?
California PageCopy and paste all content from the section above for the
National page into this section.In addition, to the right of the text
"Big Idea", list the codes of the CA Focus standards covered in the
module. The codes should be listed in the order they appear in the [CA
math standards
PDF](https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/ccssmathstandardaug2013.pdf).What
is the flow of the module?Enter the number of days for "Lessons" in the
form "X Days". Each lesson is 1 day for Grades K-5 and 2 days for\
Grades 6-A1. So, for example, if a module has 6 lessons, you would enter
"6 Days" if the module is in K-5 and "12 Days" if the module is in
6-A1.In the text "Module X Project", replace "X" with the module
number.What lessons are in this module?The text after "A lesson is:"
should be as follows for\
Grades K-5:Approximately 45 minutes of an Essential Session15+ minutes
of suggested Differentiation and Practice OpportunitiesThe text after "A

[Kindergarten will follow the guidelines above for the majority of the
sections, however there are additional GK considerations that need to be
made when authoring the EMM. Information about those considerations will
be found within this
section.](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1523366055710?s=f8zkt8htnd6if5axdxvz9bo6yaoumfws)

[Kindergarten is the only grade that is image based, so the content
needs a specific page style to organize the images. There needs to be a
total of 6 pages in each GK lesson, unless otherwise indicated in the
TOC. Page styles can be mixed and matched to reach this page
requirement.](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1523366055710?s=f8zkt8htnd6if5axdxvz9bo6yaoumfws)

[Images can be organized within one task, or may be organized across
multiple tasks. If multiple source lesson tasks share a direction line,
those tasks will be considered **one** task in v2. Choose a [page
layout](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1599606687881) (Styles A-F) for a
*single* task and include it in the EMM in the Print Page Style row. If
multiple source lesson tasks share a direction line but include separate
stories, those tasks will be considered separate tasks. (Please author
the direction line in both tasks, but the direction line should be gray
in the second task since it will not appear in print twice. The stories
should be black in both tasks.) Choose a [page
layout](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1599606687881) (Styles G-M) for a
*multiple* tasks and include it in the EMM in the Print Page Style
row.If for any reason a page style needs to be modified, such as needed
two small boxes side by side where the page style only shows one long
box, a note to COMP can be included in the same row in the EMM that the
page style is indicated. In brackets, please tell COMP the modification
you need for that page style. For example, if instead of two large boxes
stacked on top of each other such as in Style B you needed one large box
and two smaller boxes below side by side, you can instruct comp to make
that change. ![](media/image41.png){width="5.75in"

[May choose a layout that resembles what was done for v1 for p/u
lessonsRevised/new lessons will require a page style that makes sense
for the content Page types for new/revised lessons should be chosen **at
the end** of authoring the EMM to ensure all the content is represented
correctlyThe task number on the EMM will correlate with the color and
icon. Any page style can be used for any task. For example, if Task 1
needs Page Style A (one large single box) and Task 2 also needs Page
Style A, comp will know to change the icon and colors.[Please fill out
the Page Layout of the Lesson table in the Before You Teach section to
ensure that the page layout works with the number of pages as well as
the master templates that cannot change. The order of pages may be
rearranged to account for the layout of the lesson. For example, if
there are two full pages of tasks, then page 2 and 3 would both be tasks
x--x, page 4 would be Rev SYL, page 5 would be QC master, and there
would be only 1 page for PoYO. **In any case where there are 8 pages
listed on the TOC instead of 6, additional columns may be added to
account for those pages.** Add any modifications that are needed within
the brackets after the page style letter (included on
template).]{.mark}![](media/image42.png){width="4.666666666666667in"

[Some sections will have **master templates** -- parts of these
templates do not change:SYL -- The SYL must be one image that fits
inside of the templated box. Size of box and location of box do not
change. SYL Review -- This image is the same as the SYL above. Size of
box and location of box do not change.Quick Check -- This is templated
on the page meaning the **location** cannot change. However, if two
smaller images side-by-side are needed, that modification *may* be made.
Can include a note to comp similar to above.Assess Learning Goal --
Boilerplate. Does not changeOther sections of the template have **Page
Styles.** These page styles may be chosen from the templates linked and
modified as needed:*Tasks* and *Practice on Your Own* are the only
sections that need [page
styles](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1599606687881) indicated for
**Lesson Level EMMs** and the same rules apply to each. The main
difference is that the word Task will appear before the icon on the
page, and the words Practice on Your Own will appear before the icon on
the page. This is already indicated within the section of the EMM, so no
need to do anything additional here besides choosing the page style.
**Prerequisite Check** (formerly known as Are You Ready) and *Module
Review* will also require [page

[May choose a layout that resembles what was done for v1 for p/u
lessonsIf a V1 lesson has 3 tasks, Task 1 needs to take up the whole
page (Styles A--F) and Task 2 needs to sit above the Review SYL, Task 3
becomes Quick Check above Learning Goals.If a V1 lesson has 4 tasks,
Task 1 and Task 2 needs to be represented using a page style from G--J,
Task 3 needs to sit above the Review SYL, Task 4 becomes Quick Check
above Learning Goals.If a V1 lesson has more than 4 tasks, any mix of
page styles can be used as long as the second to last task sits above
the SYL Review and the last task becomes the Quick Check.For visuals,

[If a lesson is new or revised, any mix of page styles can be used if
the master templates are still considered.Best practice to author the
EMM last, and then consider the page type that will correctly reflect
the sequence of the tasks. Remember that the SYL Review section does not
move, so there needs to be a task on the page above it. Additionally
remember the Assess Learning Goal section does not move, so there must
be a Quick Check above it.

[Not every v1 page style will work for v2 since we have two templated
pages that require content in specific places (Review SYL page and Quick
Check). We have pulled out some known issues and solutions for when
source lesson page styles do not work. All issues are also represented
visually in the [GK Page Styling Slide
Deck](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1608780688544).](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1523366055710?s=f8zkt8htnd6if5axdxvz9bo6yaoumfws)

[**ISSUE 1:** There are 2 tasks and the second task becomes the quick
check. No task to put above Review SYL.**SOLUTION 1:** Pull in a problem
from the On Your Own section in V1 if there are more than 2 POYO
problems.**ISSUE 2:** There are 2 tasks and 2 POYO. No problem to put
above the quick check.**SOLUTION 2:** Since all tasks from v1 are
accounted for, a new task would need to be written to be placed as Task
2.Before determining if a lesson requires new content to fit the page
structures and the 6-page rule, please ensure none of the following is
possible:Manipulating the page type to possibly having 1 task per page
(multiple A style pages in a lesson)Not combining two tasks that share a
direction line (typically the rule is if multiple tasks share a
direction line it becomes one task, but if it affects the page styling
we would consider this an exception to the rule before advocating for
new content)Picking up a PoYO item and placing it as a task (if there
are multiple PoYOs to choose from- should have 2 minimum per lesson)If
all suggestions have been considered but are not effective, please email
HMH the lesson that would need new content for approval before writing
new content.**ISSUE 3:** If there are enough tasks but the page styles
that are most similar from v1 result in only 5 pages, not 6.**SOLUTION
3:** Choose page types that allow the tasks to be spread out to reach 6
pages.**ISSUE 4:** There are 2 tasks and the second task becomes the
quick check. No task to put above Review SYL.**SOLUTION 4:** Pull in a
problem from the On Your Own section in V1 if there are more than 2 POYO
problems (if not, see Solution
2).](https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1523366055710?s=f8zkt8htnd6if5axdxvz9bo6yaoumfws)

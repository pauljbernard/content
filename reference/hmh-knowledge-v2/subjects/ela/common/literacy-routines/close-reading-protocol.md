# Close Reading Protocol
**Literacy Routine for Deep Text Analysis**
**Scope:** Subject-Common (all ELA programs, all districts)
**Audience:** Curriculum developers creating reading comprehension lessons

---

## Overview

**Close Reading** is a systematic approach to reading and rereading complex texts to build deep comprehension. Students read the same text multiple times, each with a different focus, moving from literal understanding to analysis and inference.

**Core Principle:** Multiple readings with increasing cognitive demand lead to deeper comprehension than a single reading.

**Literacy Routine Type:** Interpretive (reading/listening comprehension)

---

## Purpose and Benefits

### Why Use Close Reading?

**For All Students:**
- Develops stamina for complex texts
- Builds comprehension strategies
- Deepens understanding through rereading
- Focuses attention on evidence in text

**For Emergent Bilinguals:**
- First read removes language barriers
- Multiple exposures build vocabulary
- Scaffolded questions support access
- Text-dependent focus reduces background knowledge demands

**For Complex Texts:**
- Reveals layers of meaning
- Supports analysis of author's craft
- Enables discussion of themes and ideas

---

## Close Reading Structure

### Three Reads with Increasing Depth:

**First Read: Literal Understanding (What does it say?)**
- Purpose: Understand the gist
- Focus: Key details, events, main idea
- Question types: Who, what, when, where

**Second Read: Deeper Meaning (How does it say it?)**
- Purpose: Analyze structure and craft
- Focus: Author's choices, vocabulary, text structure
- Question types: How, why (craft), word choice analysis

**Third Read: Beyond the Text (What does it mean?)**
- Purpose: Infer themes, author's purpose, make connections
- Focus: Themes, inferences, critical thinking
- Question types: Why (meaning), what theme, how does this connect

**Variation:** Some protocols use 2 reads, others use 4. Three is most common.

## Step-by-Step Protocol

### Before Reading:

**1. Select Complex, Grade-Level Text**
- Worthy of multiple readings
- Rich vocabulary and ideas
- Appropriate length (shorter for younger grades)
- Culturally relevant and engaging

**2. Prepare Text-Dependent Questions**
- Sequence questions from literal → inferential → analytical
- Require evidence from text
- Build on each other

**3. Identify Key Vocabulary**
- Tier 2 words (high-utility academic)
- Tier 3 words (domain-specific)
- Words critical to meaning

---

### First Read: What Does the Text Say?

**Purpose:** Establish literal comprehension

**Process:**
1. **Read Aloud** (teacher or audio) OR **Independent Read**
   - Students listen/read without interruption
   - Focus on understanding the story/information

2. **Initial Response**
   - Quick share: "What is this text about?"
   - Partner turn-and-talk
   - Capture gist in 1-2 sentences

3. **Literal Comprehension Questions**
   - Who are the main characters?
   - What happened in this text?
   - Where and when does it take place?
   - What is the main idea or event?

**Scaffolds:**
- **Emerging EBs:** Visuals, glossary of key terms, sentence frame: "This text is about ___."
- **All Students:** Annotation guide (underline main idea, circle characters)

**Example Questions (Grade 5 Narrative):**
- Who is the main character?
- What problem does the character face?
- What happens at the end of the story?

**DOK Level:** 1-2 (Recall and basic comprehension)

---

### Second Read: How Does the Text Say It?

**Purpose:** Analyze author's craft, vocabulary, and structure

**Process:**
1. **Reread with Focus**
   - Students read independently or in pairs
   - Annotation focus: Author's word choices, text structure

2. **Vocabulary Analysis**
   - Identify key words
   - Determine meaning from context
   - Discuss connotation and impact

3. **Craft and Structure Questions**
   - How does the author describe [character/setting]?
   - Why did the author choose the word "___" instead of "___"?
   - How is the text organized? (chronological, compare/contrast, cause/effect)
   - What text features help you understand? (headings, captions, graphics)

**Scaffolds:**
- **Emerging:** Sentence frames: "The author uses the word ___ to show ___."
- **Expanding:** Graphic organizer comparing word choices
- **Bridging:** Independent annotation with vocabulary analysis

**Example Questions (Grade 5 Narrative):**
- How does the author show that the character is nervous? (Find evidence)
- Why does the author use a flashback in paragraph 3?
- What does the word "trudged" tell you about how the character feels?

**DOK Level:** 2-3 (Skill/Concept to Strategic Thinking)

---

### Third Read: What Does the Text Mean?

**Purpose:** Infer themes, analyze author's purpose, make connections

**Process:**
1. **Final Reread** (focus sections, not necessarily entire text)
   - Target key passages for deeper analysis
   - Annotation focus: Themes, inferences, author's message

2. **Inferential and Analytical Questions**
   - What is the theme or message?
   - Why did the author write this text?
   - How does this connect to [other text/your life/the world]?
   - What can you infer about [character's motivation/author's perspective]?

3. **Extended Response or Discussion**
   - Essay, short answer, or Socratic seminar
   - Cite evidence from all three reads

**Scaffolds:**
- **Emerging:** Sentence frames: "I think the theme is ___ because ___."
- **Expanding:** Graphic organizer for theme with evidence
- **Bridging:** Independent thesis statement with multiple pieces of evidence

**Example Questions (Grade 5 Narrative):**
- What is the theme of this story? Use evidence from the text.
- How does the character change from the beginning to the end? Why?
- What is the author's message about [friendship/courage/perseverance]?

**DOK Level:** 3-4 (Strategic to Extended Thinking)

## Question Sequence Design

### Principles for Text-Dependent Questions:

**1. Start Literal, Build to Inferential**
   - Early questions establish understanding
   - Later questions require analysis

**2. Require Evidence**
   - "Find the sentence that shows..."
   - "What evidence supports...?"
   - Avoid questions answerable without the text

**3. Build on Previous Answers**
   - Questions connect to form a pathway
   - Later questions use information from earlier ones

**4. Target Key Understandings**
   - Focus on what's most important
   - Don't ask about every detail

---

### Sample Question Sequence (Grade 3 Fable):

**First Read (Literal):**
1. Who are the characters in this fable?
2. What does the fox want?
3. What happens when the fox can't reach the grapes?

**Second Read (Craft/Structure):**
4. How does the author describe the grapes in paragraph 1?
5. What does the word "scornfully" mean in the last sentence?
6. How does the fox's attitude change from the beginning to the end?

**Third Read (Inference/Theme):**
7. Why does the fox say the grapes are sour?
8. What is the moral (lesson) of this fable?
9. How does this fable's message apply to real life?

## Assessment with Close Reading

### Formative Assessment During Close Reading:

**Observe:**
- Annotations (are students marking key ideas?)
- Discussion participation (citing evidence?)
- Written responses (using text evidence?)

**Check for Understanding:**
- After First Read: Can students summarize?
- After Second Read: Can students analyze craft?
- After Third Read: Can students infer theme/meaning?

---

### Summative Assessment After Close Reading:

**Constructed Response:**
- Provide text (same or new)
- Ask analytical question requiring evidence
- Use 2-point rubric (claim + evidence)

**Example Prompt:**
"What is the theme of this story? Support your answer with evidence from the text."

## Common Close Reading Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Questions Not Text-Dependent

**Problem:** "Have you ever felt like this character?" (answerable without reading)

**Fix:** "How does the author show the character's feelings? Cite evidence."

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Only One Read

**Problem:** Single read misses the benefit of close reading

**Fix:** Plan time for 2-3 reads (can be across multiple days)

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Teacher Doing All the Work

**Problem:** Teacher explains everything, students passive

**Fix:** Ask questions, let students discover, guide through questioning

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Text Too Easy

**Problem:** Simple text doesn't require close reading

**Fix:** Choose complex, grade-level text worthy of analysis

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: No Scaffolds for EBs

**Problem:** Expecting same output from all proficiency levels

**Fix:** Differentiate scaffolds (sentence frames, visuals, partner support)

---

## Time Allocation

### Option 1: Single Lesson (45-60 min)

- First Read: 10 min (read + gist)
- Second Read: 15 min (reread + craft analysis)
- Third Read: 15 min (reread key parts + inference)
- Discussion/Writing: 10-15 min

**Best for:** Shorter texts (1-2 pages)

---

### Option 2: Multi-Day (20-30 min per day)

- Day 1: First Read (literal comprehension)
- Day 2: Second Read (craft and vocabulary)
- Day 3: Third Read + Extended Writing (inference, theme)

**Best for:** Longer texts (3-5 pages), younger grades

**Remember:** Close Reading is not about reading slowly—it's about reading strategically with increasing depth. Each read has a purpose. Questions should scaffold from literal to inferential to analytical. The goal is deep comprehension and the ability to cite evidence, skills that transfer to all academic reading.

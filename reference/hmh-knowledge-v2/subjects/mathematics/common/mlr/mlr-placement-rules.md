## Core Placement Rules

### Rule 1: One MLR Per Task (Maximum)

**Rule:** Do NOT use the same MLR twice within a single Task.

**Why:**
- Redundancy doesn't add value
- Student fatigue from repetition
- Takes time away from problem-solving

**Example:**
❌ WRONG:
- Task 1, Part A: MLR7 Compare and Connect
- Task 1, Part C: MLR7 Compare and Connect (same task!)

✅ CORRECT:
- Task 1: MLR7 Compare and Connect
- Task 2: MLR1 Stronger and Clearer Each Time (different task)

---

### Rule 2: Vary MLRs Across Tasks

**Rule:** Use different MLRs across Tasks within the same lesson when possible.

**Why:**
- Variety maintains engagement
- Different routines serve different purposes
- Exposes students to multiple language-building approaches

**Example:**
✅ GOOD VARIETY:
- Task 1: MLR6 Three Reads (comprehension)
- Task 2: MLR7 Compare and Connect (after solving)
- Task 3: MLR1 Stronger and Clearer Each Time (refining)

❌ POOR VARIETY:
- Task 1: MLR1
- Task 2: MLR1
- Task 3: MLR1 (all the same!)

---

### Rule 3: Match MLR to Purpose

**Rule:** Select the MLR that best serves the instructional goal for that Task.

**Why:**
- Each MLR has a specific purpose
- Mismatched MLRs feel forced and ineffective
- Right routine enhances the mathematical goal

**Decision Framework:**

**Goal: Help students understand word problem**
→ Use MLR6 (Three Reads)

**Goal: Compare different solution methods**
→ Use MLR7 (Compare and Connect)

**Goal: Develop precise explanations**
→ Use MLR1 (Stronger and Clearer)

**Goal: Address a misconception**
→ Use MLR3 (Critique, Correct, Clarify)

**Goal: Build math vocabulary over time**
→ Use MLR2 (Collect and Display)

---

### Rule 4: Timing Matters

**Rule:** Place MLRs at the appropriate point in the problem-solving process.

**BEFORE Solving:**
- MLR6 (Three Reads) - for comprehension
- MLR5 (Co-Craft Questions) - for generating questions
- MLR4 (Information Gap) - for building need for precision

**DURING Solving:**
- MLR8 (Discussion Supports) - while students work
- MLR2 (Collect and Display) - capturing language as it emerges

**AFTER Solving:**
- MLR1 (Stronger and Clearer) - refining explanations
- MLR7 (Compare and Connect) - comparing strategies
- MLR3 (Critique, Correct, Clarify) - analyzing errors

**Example:**
❌ WRONG TIMING:
Use MLR6 Three Reads AFTER students have solved problem (too late)

✅ CORRECT TIMING:
Use MLR6 Three Reads BEFORE students solve to aid comprehension

---

## MLR Selection Framework

### Step 1: Identify Task Type

**Is this task primarily:**
- [ ] Word problem / contextual scenario?
- [ ] Procedure / skill practice?
- [ ] Comparison of methods / representations?
- [ ] Error analysis / misconception?
- [ ] Concept introduction / exploration?

---

### Step 2: Determine Instructional Goal

**What do you want students to do:**
- [ ] Understand the problem context?
- [ ] Develop precise vocabulary?
- [ ] Compare different approaches?
- [ ] Refine their explanations?
- [ ] Analyze errors?
- [ ] Generate questions?
- [ ] Discuss with partners?

---

### Step 3: Select Matching MLR

Use this decision tree:

```
START: What is the task?

├─ Is it a WORD PROBLEM with context?
│  └─ Use MLR6 (Three Reads) BEFORE solving
│
├─ Will students use DIFFERENT STRATEGIES?
│  └─ Use MLR7 (Compare and Connect) AFTER solving
│
├─ Is there STUDENT WORK WITH ERROR to analyze?
│  └─ Use MLR3 (Critique, Correct, Clarify) AFTER solving
│
├─ Do students need to REFINE EXPLANATION?
│  └─ Use MLR1 (Stronger and Clearer) AFTER solving
│
├─ Are you BUILDING VOCABULARY over time?
│  └─ Use MLR2 (Collect and Display) DURING or AFTER
│
├─ Do students need DISCUSSION SUPPORT?
│  └─ Use MLR8 (Discussion Supports) DURING discussion
│
├─ Are students GENERATING QUESTIONS?
│  └─ Use MLR5 (Co-Craft Questions) BEFORE solving
│
└─ Is there an INFORMATION GAP to create need?
   └─ Use MLR4 (Information Gap) BEFORE or DURING
```

---

### Step 4: Validate Selection

Ask:
- [ ] Does this MLR fit the timing (before, during, or after)?
- [ ] Have I used a different MLR for previous tasks in this lesson?
- [ ] Does this MLR serve the instructional goal?
- [ ] Is there enough time (7-15 minutes typically)?
- [ ] Will this enhance or distract from learning?

---

## Frequency Guidelines by MLR

### VERY HIGH Frequency: MLR6 (Three Reads)

**When to Use:**
- Every word problem with context
- Every task with scenario or story
- Any problem requiring comprehension before solving

**Frequency:** 60-80% of lessons with contextual problems

**Why So Often:**
- Most directly supports problem comprehension
- Quick (5-7 minutes)
- High impact for EBs
- Required for ELPS alignment

---

### HIGH Frequency: MLR7 (Compare and Connect)

**When to Use:**
- When multiple solution strategies exist
- After tasks where students took different approaches
- When comparing representations or concepts

**Frequency:** 40-60% of lessons

**Why Often:**
- Multiple strategies are common
- Builds meta-awareness
- Validates diverse thinking
- Deepens conceptual understanding

---

### HIGH Frequency: MLR8 (Discussion Supports)

**When to Use:**
- During any partner or small group discussion
- When students need sentence frames
- When facilitating whole-class discourse

**Frequency:** 50-70% of lessons

**Why Often:**
- Not a standalone routine (supports other MLRs)
- Can be embedded in any discussion
- Flexible and adaptable
- Essential for EB support

**Note:** MLR8 often pairs with other MLRs.

---

### MODERATE Frequency: MLR1, MLR2, MLR3

**When to Use:**
- **MLR1:** When explanation quality matters (30-40% of lessons)
- **MLR2:** When introducing key vocabulary (30-40% of lessons)
- **MLR3:** When addressing misconceptions (20-30% of lessons)

**Why Moderate:**
- Valuable but time-intensive
- Not every task needs these
- Used strategically when most impactful

---

### LOW Frequency: MLR4, MLR5

**When to Use:**
- **MLR4:** Special activities with information gap structure (10-20%)
- **MLR5:** When problem generation is the goal (5-10%)

**Why Less Often:**
- Require specific task structures
- More complex to implement
- Take significant time (15-20 minutes)
- High impact when used, but not universally applicable

---

## Placement Patterns by Lesson Section

### Spark Your Learning (SYL)

**Typical Structure:**
1. Open-ended problem presented
2. Students explore and solve
3. Discussion of strategies

**Best MLRs for SYL:**
- **MLR6 Three Reads** (if contextual) - BEFORE solving
- **MLR7 Compare and Connect** - AFTER solving (comparing strategies)
- **MLR8 Discussion Supports** - DURING class discussion

**Example SYL Implementation:**
```
Spark Your Learning: [Contextual problem about pizza fractions]

BEFORE students solve:
Use MLR6 Three Reads to ensure comprehension of context.

AFTER students solve:
Use MLR7 Compare and Connect to compare different fraction strategies.
```

---

### Tasks (Learn Together)

**Typical Structure:**
1. Concept introduced
2. Students work through parts (A, B, C, etc.)
3. Discussion and synthesis

**Best MLRs for Tasks:**
- **MLR6 Three Reads** - if part is contextual problem
- **MLR7 Compare and Connect** - comparing different methods
- **MLR1 Stronger and Clearer** - refining explanations
- **MLR3 Critique, Correct, Clarify** - if error analysis is presented
- **MLR8 Discussion Supports** - during partner work

**Example Task Implementation:**
```
Task 2: Students solve multi-step equations using two methods.

AFTER completing both methods:
Use MLR7 Compare and Connect. Have students discuss which method they
prefer and when each is most efficient.
```

---

### Practice and Homework

**Typical Structure:**
- Independent problem practice
- Mixed review

**MLRs in Practice:**
- **Generally not used** (independent work)
- Exception: Can suggest MLR strategies for homework help
  - "If you're stuck on a word problem, use the Three Reads strategy"

---

## Combining MLRs (Advanced)

### MLR Pairs That Work Well Together:

**MLR6 + MLR7:**
- MLR6 to comprehend problem (BEFORE)
- MLR7 to compare solutions (AFTER)

**Example:**
"Use Three Reads to understand the context. Then after solving, use Compare and Connect to discuss different strategies."

---

**MLR1 + MLR2:**
- MLR1 to refine explanations (AFTER)
- MLR2 to capture refined language for display (ONGOING)

**Example:**
"Use Stronger and Clearer to refine your explanation. Then I'll collect precise phrases for our word wall."

---

**MLR7 + MLR8:**
- MLR7 to structure comparison (AFTER)
- MLR8 to provide discussion supports during MLR7 (DURING)

**Example:**
"Use Compare and Connect to discuss strategies. Here are sentence frames to help: 'Both methods...' 'A key difference is...'"

---

**MLR3 + MLR8:**
- MLR3 to analyze error (AFTER)
- MLR8 to support critique discussion (DURING)

**Example:**
"Use Critique, Correct, Clarify with this error. Use these frames: 'The error is...' 'The correct approach is...'"

---

### MLRs That Should NOT Be Combined:

**MLR1 + MLR7 in same task:**
- Both are post-solving routines
- Would take 15-20 minutes combined (too long)
- Choose one based on goal

**MLR3 + MLR7 in same task:**
- Different purposes (error analysis vs. strategy comparison)
- Better to separate into different tasks

---

## Overuse and Underuse: Finding Balance

### Signs of OVERUSE:

**Problem:** Too many MLRs in one lesson
- ❌ Every task has an MLR
- ❌ Multiple MLRs per task
- ❌ Students spend more time on routines than math

**Impact:**
- Student fatigue
- Routines feel forced
- Less time for problem-solving
- Diminishing returns

**Solution:**
- Limit to 2-3 MLRs per lesson maximum
- Use strategically where highest impact
- Prioritize math over routine

---

### Signs of UNDERUSE:

**Problem:** No MLRs or inconsistent use
- ❌ Weeks without an MLR
- ❌ Only using easiest MLR (avoiding others)
- ❌ Missing opportunities for language development

**Impact:**
- EBs lack language support
- Mathematical communication doesn't develop
- ELPS alignment gaps

**Solution:**
- Set minimum: At least 1 MLR every 2 lessons
- Prioritize MLR6 (Three Reads) for contextual problems
- Build familiarity with all 8 routines

---

## Placement Decision Flowchart

```
START: Planning a lesson with 3-4 Tasks

Step 1: Identify contextual word problems
├─ Any word problems? → YES → Use MLR6 (Three Reads) BEFORE solving
└─ No word problems? → Continue to Step 2

Step 2: Look for strategy comparison opportunities
├─ Multiple solution methods? → YES → Use MLR7 (Compare and Connect) AFTER
└─ Single method only? → Continue to Step 3

Step 3: Check for error analysis opportunities
├─ Misconception to address? → YES → Use MLR3 (Critique, Correct, Clarify)
└─ No error analysis? → Continue to Step 4

Step 4: Consider explanation refinement
├─ Complex reasoning to explain? → YES → Use MLR1 (Stronger and Clearer)
└─ Simple tasks? → Continue to Step 5

Step 5: Add discussion supports as needed
└─ Use MLR8 (Discussion Supports) during any partner/group work

RESULT: 1-3 MLRs strategically placed across lesson
```

## Context-Specific Guidance

### For Spark Your Learning:

**Primary Options:**
1. **MLR6 (Three Reads)** if contextual
2. **MLR7 (Compare and Connect)** after solving to compare strategies

**Why These Work:**
- SYL is open-ended (often multiple strategies)
- SYL often has rich context (benefits from Three Reads)
- SYL is about exploration (comparing validates diverse thinking)

**Avoid in SYL:**
- MLR1 (too structured for open exploration)
- MLR3 (no error to analyze yet)
- MLR4 or MLR5 (SYL already has specific structure)

---

### For Tasks (Learn Together):

**Primary Options:**
- **Any MLR can work** depending on task structure
- Most common: MLR6, MLR7, MLR1, MLR3

**Selection Criteria:**
- Match to task goal
- Vary across tasks within lesson
- Consider time available

**Example Lesson:**
- Task 1: MLR6 (word problem)
- Task 2: MLR7 (compare methods)
- Task 3: No MLR (independent practice)
- Task 4: MLR1 (refine explanation)

---

### For Lessons with Limited Time:

**Priority MLRs:**
1. **MLR6 (Three Reads)** - 5-7 minutes, high impact
2. **MLR8 (Discussion Supports)** - embedded, flexible time
3. **Shortened MLR7** - 5 minutes instead of 10

**What to Skip:**
- MLR4 and MLR5 (take too long)
- MLR1 full cycle (skip repeat round)
- Multiple MLRs per lesson

---

## Validation Checklist for MLR Placement

### Before Finalizing Lesson:

**Overall Lesson:**
- [ ] 1-3 MLRs total in lesson (not more)
- [ ] MLRs varied across tasks (not all the same)

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### ❌ Mistake 1: Overloading lesson with MLRs
**Problem:** MLR after every single task
**Solution:** Limit to 2-3 per lesson; prioritize highest-impact

### ❌ Mistake 2: Using same MLR repeatedly
**Problem:** MLR7 for every task in a unit
**Solution:** Vary MLRs; each serves different purpose

### ❌ Mistake 3: Wrong timing
**Problem:** MLR6 after students already solved
**Solution:** Follow before/during/after guidelines strictly

### ❌ Mistake 4: Forcing MLR into task
**Problem:** Task doesn't have multiple strategies, but using MLR7 anyway
**Solution:** Only use when authentic fit; it's OK to have tasks without MLRs

### ❌ Mistake 5: Skipping MLR6 for word problems
**Problem:** EB students struggle with comprehension
**Solution:** Always use MLR6 for contextual problems (ELPS requirement)

### ❌ Mistake 6: No time allocation
**Problem:** MLR added but no time for it in lesson
**Solution:** Plan time; adjust if needed (shorten other components)

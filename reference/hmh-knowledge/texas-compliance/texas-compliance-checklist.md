# Texas Compliance Checklist - Into Math TX
**Purpose:** Master validation checklist combining ALL Texas requirements
**Sources:** SBOE Quality Rubric + IPACC Suitability Requirements + TEKS Alignment
**Use:** Validate ALL content before submission to Texas

---

## Overview

This checklist combines **three critical compliance layers**:
1. **SBOE Quality Rubric** - 6 quality dimensions for instructional excellence
2. **IPACC Suitability Requirements** - Content restrictions and prohibitions
3. **TEKS Alignment** - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills standards

**All three must pass** for Texas adoption approval.

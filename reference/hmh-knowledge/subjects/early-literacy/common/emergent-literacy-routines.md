# Emergent Literacy Routines for Pre-K
**Age Range:** 3-5 years
**Level:** Pre-K, Transitional Kindergarten

---

## Overview

Emergent literacy describes the reading and writing behaviors that precede conventional literacy. Through play, conversations, and meaningful interactions with print, young children develop foundational literacy skills.

---

## Five Components of Emergent Literacy

### 1. Print Awareness

**What:** Understanding that print carries meaning

**Milestones:**
- Age 3: Recognizes environmental print (STOP sign, McDonald's logo)
- Age 4: Knows books have titles, authors; print read left-to-right
- Age 5: Tracks print with finger while reading; recognizes some letters

**Instructional Routines:**
- **Print-Rich Environment:** Labels, charts, children's names, signs
- **Shared Reading:** Point to words while reading aloud
- **Environmental Print Walks:** Notice print in classroom and outside
- **Name Activities:** Children see and write own names daily

---

### 2. Phonological Awareness

**What:** Awareness of sounds in spoken language

**Progression:**
- Rhyming (cat, hat, mat)
- Syllables (clapping: "ap-ple" = 2)
- Beginning sounds (/c/ in "cat")
- Phoneme segmentation (age 5-6: /c/ /a/ /t/)

**Instructional Routines:**
- **Rhyming Games:** Read rhyming books, generate rhymes
- **Syllable Clapping:** Clap names, words
- **Sound Sorts:** Sort pictures by beginning sound
- **Songs and Chants:** Emphasize sounds in words

**Age-Appropriate:**
- Pre-K focus: Rhyming, syllables, beginning sounds
- Kindergarten: Phoneme segmentation and blending

### 3. Alphabet Knowledge

**What:** Letter names, sounds, and formation

**Milestones:**
- Age 3: Recognizes a few letters (often in own name)
- Age 4: Knows several letter names and sounds
- Age 5: Knows most uppercase letters, many lowercase; connects letters to sounds

**Instructional Routines:**
- **Alphabet Wall:** With pictures for each letter
- **Letter of the Week:** (Use cautiously—don't delay reading instruction)
- **Name Recognition:** Start with letters in children's names
- **Multi-Sensory:** Trace letters in sand, form with playdough, skywriting
- **Embedded:** Point out letters during shared reading, writing

---

### 4. Vocabulary and Oral Language

**What:** Understanding and using spoken language

**Rapid Growth in Pre-K:**
- Age 3: 1,000-2,000 words
- Age 5: 2,000-3,000 words
- Academic vocabulary begins

**Instructional Routines:**
- **Rich Conversations:** Ask open-ended questions, extend children's language
- **Interactive Read-Alouds:** Define new words, discuss
- **Dramatic Play:** Vocabulary-rich themes (doctor's office, restaurant)
- **Explicit Vocabulary Instruction:** Teach 2-3 words per book
- **Repetition:** Use new words multiple times in varied contexts

---

### 5. Comprehension and Book Knowledge

**What:** Understanding stories, how books work

**Milestones:**
- Age 3: Listens to short stories, answers simple questions
- Age 4: Retells familiar stories, predicts what happens next
- Age 5: Understands story elements (characters, setting), makes inferences

**Instructional Routines:**
- **Interactive Read-Alouds:** Before/during/after questions
- **Story Retelling:** Use props, puppets, felt boards
- **Book Talks:** Discuss favorite books
- **Author Study:** Read multiple books by same author

---

## Instructional Routines

### 1. Interactive Read-Aloud (Daily, 15-20 min)

**Before Reading:**
- Introduce title, author, illustrator
- Make predictions from cover
- Activate prior knowledge: "What do you know about...?"

**During Reading:**
- Pause to discuss
- Define new vocabulary in context
- Ask prediction questions
- Point to print occasionally

**After Reading:**
- Retell story together
- Discuss characters, events
- Make connections (text-to-self, text-to-world)
- Extend with activity (art, dramatic play)

---

### 2. Shared Writing (3-4x per week, 10-15 min)

**What:** Teacher writes while children contribute ideas

**Examples:**
- Morning message
- Class chart ("What we learned about butterflies")
- Story innovation (rewrite familiar story with new details)
- Recipe or instructions

**Why Powerful:**
- Demonstrates that writing communicates ideas
- Shows directionality (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- Connects sounds to letters
- Models conventions (spaces, capitals, punctuation)

**Process:**
1. Discuss what to write
2. Teacher writes while thinking aloud: "I'm going to write 'Today is Monday.' Today starts with /t/. What letter makes /t/? Right, T!"
3. Read together, pointing to words
4. Display writing in classroom

---

### 3. Independent "Writing" (Choice time, daily)

**What:** Children make marks with purpose

**Progression:**
- Scribbling (looks like writing)
- Letter-like forms
- Random letters
- Beginning/ending sounds (D for "dog")
- Invented spelling (KT for "cat")
- Conventional spelling (emerging kindergarten)

**Support:**
- Provide varied writing tools (crayons, markers, chalk, stamps)
- Create writing center with purpose (sign-up sheets, cards, lists)
- Accept all attempts
- Ask: "Tell me about your writing"
- Don't expect conventional spelling in Pre-K

---

### 4. Name Activities (Daily)

**Why Names:**
- Personally meaningful
- Motivation to learn letters
- Foundation for all literacy

**Activities:**
- Name cards for attendance, jobs
- Find your name game
- Name puzzles
- Sign artwork
- Compare names (length, beginning letters, shared letters)

---

## Assessment

**Observation:**
- Does child choose books during free play?
- Does child hold book correctly, turn pages?
- Does child pretend to read?
- Does child notice print in environment?
- Does child attempt to write (scribble, letters)?
- Can child rhyme?
- Does child know any letter names/sounds?

**Documentation:**
- Work samples showing writing progression
- Anecdotal notes during literacy activities
- Checklist of letter recognition (periodically, not timed test)

## Quick Reference

**Emergent Literacy Development Pre-K:**
- ✅ Read aloud daily (15-20 minutes)
- ✅ Provide print-rich environment
- ✅ Teach through play and meaningful contexts
- ✅ Focus on oral language and vocabulary

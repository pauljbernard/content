# Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) for Pre-K
**Age Range:** 3-5 years
**Level:** Pre-K, Transitional Kindergarten (TK)
**Applies To:** All Pre-K curriculum and classroom practices

---

## Overview

Social-emotional development is the foundation for all other learning in early childhood. Children must feel safe, secure, and emotionally regulated before they can engage in cognitive learning.

**Key Principle:** "Children learn best when they feel emotionally safe and connected to caring adults."

## Core Components of Pre-K SEL

### The Five SEL Competencies (CASEL Framework, adapted for Pre-K)

#### 1. Self-Awareness

**Definition:** Understanding one's own emotions, thoughts, and values.

**Developmental Milestones (Ages 3-5):**
- Recognizing and naming basic emotions (happy, sad, mad, scared)
- Beginning to understand what triggers emotions
- Expressing likes and dislikes
- Developing sense of self (identity, preferences)

**Teaching Strategies:**
- **Emotion Vocabulary:** Teach feeling words explicitly with photos/expressions
- **Feelings Check-In:** "How are you feeling today?" with feeling faces chart
- **Emotion Mirrors:** Children make faces in mirror and name emotions
- **Books About Feelings:** *The Way I Feel*, *In My Heart*, *The Color Monster*
- **Narrate Emotions:** "You look frustrated. The puzzle is tricky."

**Activities:**
- Feelings faces matching game
- "Today I feel..." daily sharing circle
- Self-portraits with "I am..." sentences
- Emotion charades

---

#### 2. Self-Management

**Definition:** Regulating emotions, thoughts, and behaviors in different situations.

**Developmental Milestones (Ages 3-5):**
- Beginning to wait and take turns (with support)
- Using words instead of physical actions when upset
- Following classroom routines
- Managing transitions (with visual supports)
- Attempting self-calming strategies (emerging)

**Teaching Strategies:**
- **Calming Strategies:** Deep breaths ("smell the flower, blow out the candle"), counting to 5, hugging self
- **Cozy Corner:** Quiet space with soft materials for self-regulation
- **Visual Schedules:** Predictable routines reduce anxiety
- **Countdown Warnings:** "5 more minutes until cleanup"
- **Positive Framing:** "Use walking feet" instead of "Don't run"
- **Practice Waiting:** Use timers, songs, games

**Activities:**
- "Turtle technique" (pull into shell when upset, then come out calm)
- Glitter jar (shake, then watch settle like emotions)
- Breathing exercises with stuffed animals on bellies
- "Stop, Think, Act" visual cues

**Important:** Self-regulation is DEVELOPING at this age. Adults must provide external regulation (calm presence, structure) while teaching internal strategies.

---

#### 3. Social Awareness

**Definition:** Understanding and respecting others' perspectives and emotions.

**Developmental Milestones (Ages 3-5):**
- Noticing when others are upset (emerging empathy)
- Beginning to take others' perspectives (but egocentrism still present)
- Recognizing that people can feel differently
- Noticing differences and similarities among people
- Understanding basic social cues

**Teaching Strategies:**
- **Narrate Others' Emotions:** "Look, Marcus is crying. How do you think he feels?"
- **Perspective-Taking Questions:** "How do you think she felt when...?"
- **Diverse Books:** Characters from various cultures, abilities, family structures
- **Classroom Helpers:** Helping others builds empathy
- **Modeling Empathy:** "I see you're hurt. How can I help?"

**Activities:**
- "How would you feel if..." scenarios
- Reading faces in photographs
- Role-playing emotions in dramatic play
- "Friend check-in" (notice if friend is absent or sad)
- Sharing stories about differences and similarities

**Cultural Note:** Expectations for eye contact, emotion expression, and social interaction vary by culture. Honor diverse norms.

---

#### 4. Relationship Skills

**Definition:** Building and maintaining healthy relationships.

**Developmental Milestones (Ages 3-5):**
- Parallel play → associative play → cooperative play
- Making friends (though friendships may be fleeting)
- Sharing and taking turns (with reminders)
- Cooperating on simple tasks
- Using words to communicate needs
- Resolving conflicts with adult support

**Teaching Strategies:**
- **Model Friendship Skills:** "Can I play with you? Thank you for sharing!"
- **Teach Scripts:** "Can I have a turn?" "You can have it when I'm done."
- **Problem-Solving Steps:**
  1. What's the problem?
  2. What are some solutions?
  3. Which will we try?
  4. Did it work?
- **Cooperative Activities:** Partnered tasks, group art projects
- **Conflict Mediation:** Coach children through conflicts (don't solve for them)

**Activities:**
- Partner games (building together, parachute play)
- "Buddy system" for transitions
- Class meetings for problem-solving
- Sharing time
- Compliment circle

**Common Conflicts (and How to Support):**
- **Toy disputes:** "You both want the truck. What can we do?" Use timer, find similar toy, play together.
- **Exclusion:** "Marcus wants to play too. How can we include him?"
- **Physical aggression:** "I can't let you hit. Hitting hurts. Use words: 'I'm mad!'"

---

#### 5. Responsible Decision-Making

**Definition:** Making constructive choices about personal and social behavior.

**Developmental Milestones (Ages 3-5):**
- Following classroom rules (with reminders)
- Making simple choices (which center, which color)
- Beginning to understand cause and effect ("If I knock over blocks, they fall")
- Learning to clean up and care for materials
- Taking on simple responsibilities (line leader, helper)

**Teaching Strategies:**
- **Offer Choices:** "Do you want to use blocks or playdough today?"
- **Natural Consequences:** "The tower fell because the base wasn't wide. What could you try?"
- **Logical Consequences:** "If we don't clean up, we won't have room for circle time."
- **Practice Routines:** Repeated practice builds responsibility
- **Classroom Jobs:** Water plants, line leader, snack helper

**Activities:**
- "What would happen if..." prediction questions
- Classroom rules co-created with children (3-5 simple rules)
- Problem-solving scenarios: "The paint spilled. What should we do?"
- Care for living things (class pet, plants)

## Creating an Emotionally Safe Classroom

### Physical Environment

**Safety and Predictability:**
- Clear classroom layout (defined centers, organized materials)
- Consistent routines (visual schedule posted)
- Cozy spaces (soft lighting, comfortable seating)
- Calming corner (pillows, books, sensory tools)
- Predictable transitions (songs, countdown timers)

**Inclusivity:**
- Diverse materials (books, dolls, posters reflecting all children)
- Accessible to all abilities
- Cultural artifacts from children's homes

---

### Emotional Climate

**Warm, Responsive Relationships:**
- Greet each child by name each morning
- Get down to child's eye level for conversations
- Positive, warm tone of voice
- Physical affection (as comfortable for child and culturally appropriate)
- Know each child's interests, family, strengths

**Positive Guidance (Not Punishment):**
- Focus on teaching, not punishing
- State expectations positively: "Use gentle hands" not "Don't hit"
- Redirect behavior: "Blocks are for building. If you want to throw, let's use balls."
- Natural and logical consequences (not time-outs or punitive measures)
- Repair harm: "You knocked over his blocks. How can you help him rebuild?"

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Shaming or embarrassing children
- ❌ Yelling or harsh tone
- ❌ Long time-outs (isolating children doesn't teach skills)
- ❌ Taking away recess/play (children need movement)
- ❌ Comparing children to each other

---

## Supporting Emotional Regulation

### The Regulation Pyramid

```
       Self-Regulation (Goal)
              ↑
      Co-Regulation (Scaffolding)
              ↑
      External Regulation (Foundation)
```

**External Regulation** (Adult provides regulation)
- Calm, predictable environment
- Consistent routines
- Clear expectations
- Adult stays calm during child's upset

**Co-Regulation** (Adult and child regulate together)
- Adult models calming: "Let's take deep breaths together"
- Narrate strategies: "I see you're upset. Let's walk away and cool down."
- Practice strategies when calm
- Stay close during upset (safe base)

**Self-Regulation** (Child regulates independently)
- Child uses strategies independently (emerging ages 4-5)
- Still needs adult support frequently at this age
- Celebrate when child uses strategies: "You took deep breaths! That helped you calm down."

---

### When Children Are Upset

**DO:**
- ✅ Stay calm yourself (you are their external regulator)
- ✅ Get down to eye level
- ✅ Name the emotion: "You're really mad that you can't have the truck"
- ✅ Validate feelings: "It's hard to wait"
- ✅ Set limits on behavior: "I can't let you hit, but you can say 'I'm mad!'"
- ✅ Offer choices: "You can play with the car or the blocks right now"
- ✅ Stay close until child is calm
- ✅ Problem-solve once calm: "Next time, what could you try?"

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Get upset yourself (escalates the situation)
- ❌ Dismiss feelings: "You're fine. It's not a big deal."
- ❌ Force apology (teach repair instead)
- ❌ Isolate (time-out in other room)
- ❌ Give in to demands (behavior will repeat)

---

### Teaching Calming Strategies

**Age 3:** Simple, concrete strategies
- Deep breaths (blow bubbles, smell flower)
- Hug self or stuffed animal
- Count to 5
- Look at calm-down bottle

**Age 4-5:** More complex strategies
- Name the feeling
- Use words to express needs
- Walk away and cool down
- Ask for help
- Use problem-solving steps

**Practice When Calm:**
- Don't teach new skills during meltdown
- Practice daily (morning calm-down routine)
- Model using strategies yourself
- Read books about calming strategies

---

## Social Skills Instruction

### Friendship Skills

**Turn-Taking:**
- Use visual timer
- Practice with songs that have clear endings
- "Your turn, my turn" language
- Games that build turn-taking (roll ball back and forth)

**Sharing:**
- Understand sharing is hard for 3-year-olds (developmentally appropriate egocentrism)
- Provide duplicates of popular toys when possible
- "You can have it when she's done" (not forced immediate sharing)
- By age 4-5, practice sharing ("Can she have a turn in 2 minutes?")

**Entering Play:**
- Teach scripts: "Can I play with you?"
- If rejected: "Maybe later. What else can you play?"
- Model asking permission
- Role-play scenarios

---

### Conflict Resolution

**The Problem-Solving Steps (Simple Version):**

**1. Identify the Problem**
Teacher: "You both want the truck. That's the problem."

**2. Generate Solutions**
Teacher: "What could we do? Let's think of ideas."
- Take turns with timer
- Find another truck
- Play together with truck
- Play something else

**3. Choose a Solution**
Teacher: "Which idea do you want to try?"

**4. Try It**
Implement chosen solution with support.

**5. Reflect**
Teacher: "Did it work? How do you feel now?"

**Teacher's Role:**
- Facilitate, don't solve
- Give language: "Tell him: 'I was using that'"
- Support both children's perspectives
- Teach skills for next time

## Challenging Behaviors

### Understanding Behavior as Communication

**All behavior communicates a need:**
- Attention (positive or negative)
- Escape/avoidance
- Sensory input
- Tangible (wants something)

**Ask:** "What is this child trying to communicate?"

---

### Common Challenging Behaviors

#### 1. Biting/Hitting

**Why it happens:**
- Frustration (can't use words yet)
- Sensory seeking
- Trying to get toy/turn
- Overwhelmed

**Response:**
- Stop behavior immediately: "I can't let you bite. Biting hurts."
- Address hurt child first
- Give language: "Say: 'I'm mad!' or 'I need help!'"
- If sensory: Provide teething toy, chewy necklace
- Problem-solve: "When you want a turn, say 'Can I have a turn?'"

---

#### 2. Tantrums/Meltdowns

**Why it happens:**
- Overwhelmed emotions (can't regulate yet)
- Tired, hungry, overstimulated
- Wants something they can't have
- Difficulty with transitions

**Response:**
- Stay calm and close (your calm is their external regulation)
- Ensure safety (move to quiet space if needed)
- Validate: "You're so upset"
- Set limit: "I hear you want the toy, but it's not your turn"
- Wait it out (don't give in or punish)
- Reconnect when calm, then problem-solve

**Prevent:**
- Predictable routine
- Warnings before transitions
- Adequate rest and nutrition
- Calming activities throughout day

---

#### 3. Refusal/Non-Compliance

**Why it happens:**
- Asserting independence (healthy!)

- Seeking attention

**Response:**
- Offer choices: "You need to clean up. Do you want to start with blocks or books?"
- Break task into steps: "First blocks, then we'll do books together"
- Make it playful: "Let's race to see how fast we can clean up!"
- Natural consequence: "If we don't clean up, we won't have room for circle time"
- Check: Is task developmentally appropriate?

---

#### 4. Separation Anxiety

**Why it happens:**
- Developmentally normal (especially ages 2-3)
- New environment
- Changes at home
- Temperament

**Response:**
- Consistent drop-off routine
- Reassure: "Mommy always comes back. She'll pick you up after nap time."
- Connect with child (special activity they like)
- Communicate with families
- Don't prolong goodbyes

---

### When to Seek Support

- Behavior interferes with learning despite consistent supports
- Regression in skills
- Trauma history or significant life stressors
- Developmental concerns

**Partners:**
- Child's family (always first step)
- Special education team
- Child psychologist or counselor
- Occupational therapist (sensory needs)
- Speech therapist (communication challenges)

---

## Family Partnership in SEL

### Communicating with Families

**Share Positive Moments:**
- "Today Jamal helped a friend who was upset!"
- Photos of positive social interactions
- Celebrate growth in SEL skills

**Address Concerns with Care:**
- Private conversation (not in front of child or other families)
- Focus on partnership: "I've noticed... Let's work together on..."
- Assume best intentions
- Share strategies that work at school
- Listen to family's perspective and home context

---

### Supporting SEL at Home

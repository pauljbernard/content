**Remember:** NYC DOE builds on New York State standards but adds significant district-specific requirements. The district's size, diversity (180+ languages), and equity focus drive additional criteria beyond state compliance. Materials must demonstrate CR-SE principles, Universal Literacy integration, robust MLL supports, and digital equity—all while maintaining alignment to NYS standards and preparing students for state assessments.

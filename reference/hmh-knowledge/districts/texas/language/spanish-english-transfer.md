# Spanish-English Transfer for ELLs
**State:** Texas (applies to all states with Spanish-speaking ELLs)
**Language Background:** Spanish speakers learning English

---

## Overview

Understanding how Spanish transfers to English helps teachers provide targeted support. Spanish-speaking ELLs bring linguistic assets—not deficits.

---

## Positive Transfer (Helps English Learning)

### 1. Cognates (30-40% of English academic vocabulary)

Spanish → English:
- familia → family
- matemáticas → mathematics
- estudiar → study
- información → information
- problema → problem

**Teaching Strategy:** Explicitly teach cognate recognition

---

### 2. Phonological Awareness

Spanish has transparent orthography (letters = sounds consistently). This helps with:
- Sound-symbol correspondence
- Decoding
- Phonemic awareness

---

### 3. Literacy Skills Transfer

Reading strategies learned in Spanish transfer to English:
- Making predictions
- Finding main idea
- Making inferences
- Comprehension monitoring

**Key:** Students literate in Spanish learn to read English faster than students with no literacy.

## Areas Requiring Support (Interference)

### 1. Phonics/Pronunciation

**Spanish sounds NOT in English:**
- Rolled /r/
- /ñ/ sound

**English sounds NOT in Spanish:**
- /th/ (think, this) → may say "tink," "dis"
- /sh/ (ship) → may say "chip"
- /v/ (very) → may say "berry" (Spanish /v/ and /b/ sound the same)
- Short vowels (sit vs. seat) → Spanish has 5 vowels, English has 15

**Teaching Strategy:**
- Minimal pairs practice (ship/chip, very/berry)
- Don't over-correct pronunciation (intelligibility is goal, not native-like accent)
- Accept approximations

---

### 2. Grammar Differences

**Adjective Placement:**
- Spanish: noun + adjective ("casa grande" = house big)
- English: adjective + noun ("big house")
- **Error:** "The house big"

**Subject Pronouns:**
- Spanish: Can drop subject ("Voy" = I go)
- English: Must include subject ("I go" not just "go")
- **Error:** "Is raining" instead of "It is raining"

**Double Negatives:**
- Spanish: Required ("No veo nada" = I don't see nothing)
- English: Non-standard ("I don't see nothing")
- **Error:** "I don't have no pencil"

**Verb Tenses:**
- Spanish present progressive used less frequently
- **Error:** "I go to the store now" instead of "I'm going to the store now"

**Teaching Strategy:**
- Teach grammar in context, not in isolation
- Provide many models of correct forms
- Gently recast errors: Student: "Is raining." Teacher: "Yes, it's raining today!"

---

### 3. False Cognates (False Friends)

Words that look similar but mean different things:
- embarazada (Spanish: pregnant) ≠ embarrassed (English)
- éxito (Spanish: success) ≠ exit (English)
- asistir (Spanish: attend) ≠ assist (English)

**Teaching Strategy:** Explicitly teach common false cognates

## Supporting Spanish-Speaking ELLs

### 1. Build on Home Language

- Welcome Spanish in classroom
- Provide bilingual books
- Encourage parents to read/speak Spanish at home (builds foundation for English)
- Label classroom in both languages

### 2. Explicit Cognate Instruction

- Teach cognate patterns (-ción → -tion, -dad → -ty)
- Create cognate walls
- Have students hunt for cognates in texts

### 3. Grammar Awareness

- Explicitly teach differences in sentence structure
- Provide sentence frames
- Model and recast (don't just mark wrong)

### 4. Pronunciation Support

- Minimal pairs practice for challenging sounds
- Don't over-correct (focus on intelligibility)
- Accept regional and dialectical variations

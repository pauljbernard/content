## Key Writing Modes

### 1. Argument Writing (Grades 9-12, Emphasis in 11-12)

**Purpose:** Persuade audience to accept a position or take action

**Key Components:**

**Claim/Thesis:**

**Reasoning:**

- Warrants (explain WHY evidence supports claim)
- Anticipate objections

**Counterclaim and Rebuttal:**
- Acknowledge opposing viewpoints
- Refute or concede and qualify
- Strengthens argument by showing fairness and thorough thinking

**Structure:**

---

**Rhetorical Appeals (Aristotelian):**

**Logos (Logic):**

**Balance:** Effective arguments use ALL three appeals appropriately

---

**4. Develop Thesis:**

- Gather information (for informative, research, argument)
- Take notes, cite sources

**Outlining:**
- Organize ideas logically
- Formal outline (I, A, 1, a) or informal (bullet points)
- Flexible (can change during drafting)

---

### 2. Drafting

**Focus on Getting Ideas Down:**
- Don't worry about perfection
- Follow outline but be flexible
- Write body paragraphs first, introduction/conclusion later (optional)

**Thesis/Claim:**
- Clear, specific, arguable (for argument)
- States main idea or controlling idea

**Body Paragraphs:**
- Topic sentence (main idea of paragraph)
- Evidence and support
- Analysis/explanation (connect evidence to claim)
- Transitions between paragraphs

**Introduction:**
- Hook (engage reader: question, quote, anecdote, surprising fact)
- Context/background
- Thesis/claim (usually last sentence of introduction)

**Conclusion:**
- Restate thesis (in new words)
- Synthesize key points
- Broader implications, call to action, or final insight
- Avoid introducing new information

---

### 3. Revising (Improving Content and Organization)

**Big-Picture Revision:**
- **Ideas:** Is thesis clear? Is argument strong? Is evidence sufficient?
- **Organization:** Is structure logical? Are paragraphs in best order? Do transitions work?

- Vary sentence beginnings (avoid starting every sentence the same way)

**Active vs. Passive Voice:**
- Active voice (subject performs action): "The committee approved the proposal."
- Passive voice (subject receives action): "The proposal was approved by the committee."
- Generally prefer active voice (clearer, more direct)
- Use passive when actor unknown or unimportant

**Parallelism:**
- Use same grammatical structure for items in list or series
- Example: "I like reading, writing, and running." (all gerunds)

**Conciseness:**

**Tone:**
- Writer's attitude toward subject and audience
- Formal, informal, serious, humorous, sarcastic, earnest, etc.
- Match tone to audience and purpose

**Formal vs. Informal:**

- **Informal:** Personal narrative, creative writing, blog (can use contractions, casual language, first person)

---

## Grammar and Conventions (High School Expectations)

### Common Grammar Issues to Master

**Subject-Verb Agreement:**
- Singular subject = singular verb
- Plural subject = plural verb
- Watch for tricky cases (indefinite pronouns, collective nouns, inverted sentences)

**Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement:**
- Pronoun must agree with noun it replaces (number, gender)
- Avoid vague pronoun reference (unclear what pronoun refers to)

**Pronoun Case:**
- Subject pronouns (I, he, she, we, they)
- Object pronouns (me, him, her, us, them)
- Possessive pronouns (my, his, her, our, their, its - no apostrophe!)

**Verb Tense:**
- Maintain consistent verb tense
- Shift only when time changes

**Comma Rules:**
- Items in a series (Oxford comma recommended)
- After introductory elements
- Between independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS)
- Around nonessential clauses/phrases
- NOT between subject and verb, or verb and object

**Semicolons:**
- Between independent clauses without conjunction
- Between items in complex series

**Apostrophes:**
- Possessive (John's book, students' work)
- Contractions (don't, it's = it is)
- NOT for plurals!

**Sentence Fragments and Run-Ons:**
- Fragment: Missing subject or verb, or doesn't express complete thought
- Run-on: Two independent clauses incorrectly joined
- Fix run-ons: Period, semicolon, comma + conjunction, or subordination

**Modifiers:**
- Place modifiers next to words they modify
- Avoid dangling modifiers

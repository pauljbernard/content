# Pre-K Assessment Guide
**Age Range:** 3-5 years
**Level:** Pre-K, Transitional Kindergarten
**Applies To:** All Pre-K content and assessment design

---

## Overview

Assessment in Pre-K is fundamentally different from K-12 assessment. Young children cannot demonstrate knowledge through traditional tests. Instead, Pre-K assessment relies on **authentic, observational, play-based methods** to document growth and guide instruction.

**Key Principle:** "Assessment should make children's learning visible without disrupting it."

---

## Core Principles of Pre-K Assessment

### 1. Observation-Based

**Why:** Young children learn through play and hands-on experiences. Observation captures learning in natural contexts.

**NOT Appropriate for Pre-K:**
- ❌ Standardized tests
- ❌ Timed assessments
- ❌ Worksheets as assessments
- ❌ High-stakes testing
- ❌ Formal letter grades (A, B, C)

**IS Appropriate for Pre-K:**
- ✅ Observational notes during play
- ✅ Photographs of children's work and engagement
- ✅ Work samples (drawings, writing attempts)
- ✅ Video documentation of learning moments
- ✅ Conversations with children about their learning
- ✅ Developmental checklists

---

### 2. Formative (Ongoing)

**Purpose:** Guide instruction, identify needs, document progress

**Frequency:** Daily observations, periodic (monthly/quarterly) checklist updates

**Use:** Adjust activities, provide targeted support, inform lesson planning

---

### 3. Developmental, Not Comparative

**Pre-K assessment compares:**
- ✅ Child to their own past performance (growth over time)
- ✅ Child to developmental milestones (is development typical?)

**Pre-K assessment does NOT compare:**
- ❌ Child to other children (ranking, competition)
- ❌ Children across classrooms or programs

---

### 4. Strengths-Based

**Focus on what children CAN do, not deficits**

Instead of: "Cannot write name"
Write: "Makes marks with purpose; experimenting with letter-like forms"

---

## Assessment Methods for Pre-K

### 1. Anecdotal Observation Notes

**What:** Brief written notes documenting specific learning moments

**When:** Daily, during play and activities

**Tools:**
- Clipboard with sticky notes
- Phone notes app
- Voice memo recordings
- Observation forms

**Example:**
```
Date: 11/6/25 | Child: Marcus | Area: Blocks
Observation: Marcus built tower using pattern:
big block, small block, big block, small block.
When tower fell, he said "I need a bigger bottom"
and rebuilt with wider base. Tower stayed up.

Learning: Patterns (ABAB), problem-solving,
spatial reasoning, cause-effect, persistence
```

**Tips:**
- Be specific, objective, descriptive (not judgmental)
- Include context
- Note language used
- Identify learning domains addressed

---

### 2. Photographs and Video

**What:** Visual documentation of children engaged in learning

**When:** Ongoing, especially for complex constructions/processes that can't be preserved

**Examples:**
- Block structures
- Dramatic play scenes
- Art in progress
- Scientific investigations
- Social interactions

**Use:**
- Share with families
- Revisit with children ("Remember when you built...?")
- Display in classroom
- Include in portfolios

**Requirements:**
- Obtain photo/video permission from families at enrollment
- Ensure privacy (don't share publicly without explicit permission)
- Focus on learning, not just "cute" moments

---

### 3. Work Samples

**What:** Artifacts children create

**Examples:**
- Drawings and paintings
- Writing attempts (scribbles, letter-like forms, invented spelling)
- Cutting/collage samples (shows fine motor progression)
- Photographs of 3D constructions

**Collection:**
- Date all work samples
- Include child's dictated description when possible
- Collect samples across all domains and time periods
- Show progression (beginning of year → end of year)

**Analysis:**
Look for growth over time:
- Drawing: Random scribbles → controlled scribbles → shapes → representational
- Writing: Random marks → letter-like forms → actual letters → name writing
- Cutting: Snipping → cutting on straight line → cutting curves
- Math: No number concepts → one-to-one counting → recognizing quantities

---

### 4. Developmental Checklists

**What:** Lists of skills/milestones organized by domain

**When:** Quarterly or biannually (3-4 times per year)

**Domains:**
- Physical Development (gross motor, fine motor, self-care)
- Cognitive Development (problem-solving, memory, attention)
- Language Development (receptive, expressive, vocabulary)
- Social-Emotional Development (self-regulation, relationships, self-awareness)
- Approaches to Learning (curiosity, persistence, creativity)
- Early Literacy (print awareness, phonological awareness, comprehension)
- Early Mathematics (number sense, shapes, patterns, measurement)

**Coding:**
- Not Yet Observed (NYO)
- Emerging (E)
- Developing (D)
- Secure (S)

**Tools:**
- Teaching Strategies GOLD
- Work Sampling System
- State-specific tools
- Custom classroom checklists

---

### 5. Learning Stories/Documentation Panels

**What:** Narrative descriptions of learning episodes with photos

**Format:**
- **What Happened:** Describe the learning episode
- **What It Means:** Analyze learning that occurred (domains, skills)
- **Where To Next:** Identify next steps for instruction

**Example:**
```
LEARNING STORY: "The Bridge Engineers"

What Happened:
Mia, Carlos, and Ava worked together in the block area for 25 minutes.
They were building a bridge for toy cars to cross. Their first bridge
collapsed when a car drove over it. They problem-solved together:
"We need more blocks underneath!" They rebuilt with more support blocks
and tested again. Success! Cars could cross.

[Photo of children building]
[Photo of final bridge structure]

What It Means:
- Engineering and Design: Testing, revising, problem-solving
- Math: Spatial reasoning, balance, stability
- Collaboration: Working together, sharing ideas, taking turns
- Persistence: Didn't give up when first attempt failed
- Language: Using descriptive language, negotiating roles

Vocabulary Used: bridge, underneath, support, balance, cross, test

Where To Next:
- Introduce ramps and inclines in block area
- Read *Iggy Peck, Architect* to extend engineering theme
- Invite children to draw blueprints before building
```

**Use:**
- Share with families
- Display in classroom
- Documentation for program quality
- Evidence for funding/accreditation

---

## Family Communication About Assessment

### Parent-Teacher Conferences

**Structure (20-30 minutes):**

1. **Welcome and Strengths** (5 min)
   - Share positive observations
   - Show work samples and photos

2. **Discuss Development Across Domains** (10 min)
   - Review checklist together
   - Share specific examples and evidence
   - Focus on growth, not comparison to peers

3. **Family Input** (5 min)
   - "What are you noticing at home?"
   - "What questions do you have?"
   - "What are your goals for your child?"

4. **Goals and Next Steps** (5 min)
   - Identify 2-3 focus areas
   - Discuss strategies for school and home
   - Make plan for follow-up

5. **Q&A** (5 min)

**Tips:**
- Use jargon-free language
- Provide interpreter if needed
- Be strengths-based while addressing concerns honestly
- Involve child (show their work, ask them to share)
- Listen to family's perspective and cultural values

---

### Progress Reports

**Format:**
- Narrative descriptions (not letter grades)
- Organized by developmental domain
- Evidence-based (reference specific observations)
- Strengths-based language
- Growth-focused (comparison to child's past performance)

**Example Entry:**
```
MATH/COGNITIVE:
Jamal is developing strong number sense. He can count objects
to 10 with one-to-one correspondence and is beginning to
recognize written numerals 1-5. He enjoys sorting and creating
patterns with manipulatives. Recently, he created a complex
ABBC pattern with colored bears (red, blue, blue, green,
red, blue, blue, green). Next steps: Continue exploring
patterns and introduce simple addition concepts with concrete
materials.
```

---

## Screening vs. Assessment

### Developmental Screening

**Purpose:** Brief check to identify children who may need further evaluation

**When:** Within first 3 months of program, annually, or when concerns arise

**Tools:**
- Ages & Stages Questionnaires (ASQ)
- Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS)

**Process:**
1. Screen all children (universal screening)
2. If concerns, refer for comprehensive evaluation
3. Partner with families throughout process

**Remember:** Screening ≠ diagnosis. It's a "red flag" system.

---

### Kindergarten Readiness Assessment

**Purpose:** Document children's skills as they transition to kindergarten

**When:** Spring of Pre-K year

**Common Tools:**
- State-specific readiness assessments
- Classroom-based assessments aligned to kindergarten standards

**Domains Assessed:**
- Early literacy and language
- Early math
- Social-emotional skills
- Approaches to learning
- Physical development

**Use:**
- Share with kindergarten teachers (with family permission)
- Celebrate growth with children and families
- Identify summer learning opportunities

**Important:** Kindergarten readiness is not a gate-keeping mechanism. All children should enter kindergarten. Assessment informs support, not exclusion.

---

## Special Considerations

### Dual Language Learners (DLLs)

**Assess in home language when possible**
- Use bilingual staff or interpreters
- Recognize that young DLLs may be "silent period" in English (normal!)
- Document skills in home language (they transfer to English)

**Expect:**
- Code-switching (mixing languages in one sentence)
- Accent or grammatical differences in English
- Stronger skills in home language initially

**Don't:**
- Mistake language difference for disability
- Assess only in English (underestimates skills)
- Rush English development

---

### Children with Disabilities

**Individualized assessment per IEP/IFSP**
- Use accommodations specified in IEP
- Partner with special education staff
- Focus on growth in IEP goals
- Celebrate all progress

**Universal Design for Assessment:**
- Offer multiple ways to demonstrate knowledge
- Provide extended time
- Use assistive technology as needed
- Assess in natural play contexts

---

## Assessment Quality Checklist

✅ **Reliable:** Consistent results over time and across observers
✅ **Authentic:** Captures learning in natural contexts (play, routines)
✅ **Developmentally appropriate:** Suited for 3-5 year olds
✅ **Culturally responsive:** Free from cultural bias, honors diversity
✅ **Strengths-based:** Focuses on what children CAN do
✅ **Actionable:** Informs instruction and support

## Quick Reference

**Pre-K Assessment Must Be:**
- ✅ Observational and play-based (NOT tests or worksheets)
- ✅ Ongoing/formative (daily observations + periodic checklists)
- ✅ Developmental (comparing child to themselves, not peers)
- ✅ Strengths-based ("can do" language)
- ✅ Authentic (natural contexts, not contrived tasks)
- ✅ Used to inform instruction and support individual children
- ✅ Communicated clearly and respectfully with families
- ✅ Culturally responsive and linguistically appropriate

**Remember:** The goal of Pre-K assessment is to make learning visible, celebrate growth, and guide teaching—never to label, sort, or rank young children.

# Texas CS TEKS Alignment
**Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for Computer Science**
**Source:** Texas Education Agency / SBOE
**Applies To:** K-12 Computer Science (Texas only)

---

## Overview

**Texas has adopted CS TEKS** aligned to CSTA with Texas-specific implementation requirements.

---

## Texas CS Courses

**Elementary (K-5):** Integrated into Technology Applications TEKS
**Middle School (6-8):** Computational Thinking, Coding, Cybersecurity (electives)
**High School (9-12):** Computer Science I, II, III; Cybersecurity; Game Design

---

## TEKS Format

**Format:** Similar to other TEKS - `Grade.Strand.Standard`
**Alignment:** 90%+ aligned to CSTA standards

---

## Texas-Specific Requirements

**Technology Applications TEKS:** K-8 technology integration including CS concepts
**SBOE Compliance:** Materials must meet SBOE quality standards

**See:** `/districts/texas/compliance/sboe-quality-rubric.md`

---

## Knowledge Reuse

**Reused (90%):** CSTA standards, computational thinking, CS pedagogy from `/subjects/computer-science/common/`

**TX-Specific (10%):** TEKS codes, course sequences, SBOE compliance

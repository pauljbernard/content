## Overview

**Effective CS pedagogy** emphasizes hands-on learning, collaboration, creativity, and inclusive practices.

---

## Key Pedagogical Approaches

**1. Project-Based Learning**
- Students create authentic computational artifacts
- Real-world problem solving
- Student choice and voice

**2. Pair Programming**
- Driver and navigator roles
- Collaborative problem solving
- Peer learning and support

**3. Unplugged Activities**
- CS concepts without computers
- Kinesthetic learning
- Accessible to all students

**4. Debugging and Iteration**
- Embracing errors as learning opportunities
- Systematic troubleshooting
- Iterative improvement

**5. Computational Media**
- Creative expression through code
- Art, music, storytelling with CS
- Engaging diverse learners

---

## Inclusive CS Practices

**Broadening Participation:**
- Culturally relevant examples and contexts
- Representation in curriculum materials
- Growth mindset messaging
- Addressing stereotypes

**Scaffolding for All Learners:**
- Multiple entry points
- Varied programming environments (block-based → text-based)
- UDL principles applied

## Assessment Practices

**Formative:** Code reviews, peer feedback, debugging challenges
**Summative:** Projects, portfolios, performance tasks
**Avoid:** Timed tests, syntax-focused assessments

---

## Knowledge Reuse

**Universal:** CS pedagogy applies to all states and programming environments

---

**Remember:** Effective CS teaching focuses on computational thinking, creativity, and inclusion rather than specific syntax or tools.

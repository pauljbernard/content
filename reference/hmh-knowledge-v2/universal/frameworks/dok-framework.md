## Overview

Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) provides a framework for categorizing the cognitive complexity of mathematics tasks and assessments. DOK has **4 levels** that describe the depth of thinking required, not the difficulty of the task.

**Key Principle:** DOK measures **complexity**, not **difficulty**.

## The 4 DOK Levels

### DOK 1: Recall
### DOK 2: Skill/Concept
### DOK 3: Strategic Thinking
### DOK 4: Extended Thinking

---

## DOK 1: Recall

### Definition
Rote recall of information or performance of a simple, routine procedure.

### Characteristics
- Student either knows the answer or doesn't
- No "figuring out" or "solving" required
- Habitual response
- Direct retrieval

### Examples

**Basic Recall:**
- Repeating memorized fact, definition, or term
- Applying a formula
- Rounding a number
- Performing simple algorithm

**Simple Procedures:**
- One-step computation or operation
- Well-defined multi-step procedure
- Direct computational algorithm
- Finding mean or median
- Performing long division

**Direct Information Access:**
- Reading information directly from a graph
- Plugging data into electronic device
- Simple paraphrasing

**Problems in Context:**
- Straightforward with obvious solution path
- May contain keyword indicating operation
- Examples: plotting points, using distance formula, drawing lines of symmetry

**Advanced Mathematics (DOK 1):**
- Symbol manipulation (if procedure is well-known)
- Solving quadratic equation using standard methods (factoring, completing square)
- Solving system of linear equations (substitution, elimination)
- Operating on polynomials or radicals
- Using laws of exponents
- Simplifying rational expressions

### Important Notes

**Verb Ambiguity:**
- "Identify attributes of polygon" = DOK 1 (recall)
- "Identify rate of change for exponential function" = DOK 2+ (analysis required)
- "Describe by listing steps" = DOK 1 (recall)
- "Describe by providing mathematical argument" = DOK 2+ (reasoning)

**Context Matters:** Classification depends on what the student is expected to do, not just the verb used.

---

## DOK 2: Skill/Concept

### Definition
Engaging in mental processing beyond habitual response, with decision-making about how to approach the problem.

### Characteristics
- Requires conceptual understanding
- Demonstrating conceptual knowledge by explaining thinking
- Deciding among and performing appropriate skills
- Applying properties or conventions in context
- Transforming among representations
- Interpreting and solving problems/graphs

### Examples

**Problem Solving:**
- Formulating equation/inequality from problem statement
- Deriving solution
- Reporting solution in context of problem

**Classification and Organization:**
- Classifying (attending to multiple attributes)
- Organizing (by features or properties)
- Estimating

**Early Grades:**
- Kindergarten: Verifying set size by matching/grouping
- Grade 1: Modeling joining/separating situation pictorially or physically

**Graphs and Functions:**
- Constructing graph
- Interpreting meaning of critical features (beyond just identifying)
- Describing effects of parameter changes
- Graphing higher-order or irregular functions (DOK 2)
- Note: Using procedure to find features of standard function = DOK 1

**Representations:**
- Illustrating computation by different representations
- Examples: equations AND base-ten model to explain results

**Data Analysis:**
- Computing measures of central tendency = DOK 1
- Interpreting measures in context = DOK 2
- Using measures to compare multiple data sets = DOK 2

**Reasoning:**
- Explaining in own words reasons for action or property application
- Note: Formal proofs = beyond DOK 2

**Visualization and Probability:**
- Mental rotation of 3D figure
- Transforming a figure
- Determining sample space
- Probability of compound event (more than simple counting)

**Procedures:**
- Detecting or describing non-trivial patterns
- Explaining purpose and use of experimental procedures
- Carrying out experimental procedures

---

## DOK 3: Strategic Thinking

### Definition
Reasoning and analyzing using mathematical principles, ideas, structure, and practices.

### Characteristics
- Non-routine problems
- More demanding, abstract, complex than DOK 2
- Sound and valid mathematical arguments
- Verifying answers, developing proofs, drawing inferences
- Solution path not evident from first reading
- Usually can be solved in different ways
- May have more than one correct solution

### Examples

**Complex Problem Solving:**
- Solving involved problems
- Conjecturing
- Creating novel solutions and representations
- Devising original proofs, mathematical arguments, critiques
- Constructing mathematical models
- Forming robust inferences and predictions

**Sophistication Depends on Context:**
- Primary school: Counting combinations, finding shortest route, computing with large numbers
- Higher grades: Abstract reasoning in logical arguments

**Problem Characteristics:**
- Not evident what is needed to derive solution
- Requires demanding reasoning to work through
- Can be solved in different ways
- May have multiple correct solutions based on different assumptions

**Proof and Argument:**
- Paraphrasing previously demonstrated proof = DOK 2
- Applying properties and producing arguments in proving new theorem/identity = DOK 3
- Producing sound, valid mathematical arguments when solving problems

**Application:**
- Making sense of mathematics in a situation
- Creating mathematical model considering contextual constraints
- Deriving new formula
- Designing and conducting experiment
- Interpreting findings

## DOK 4: Extended Thinking

### Definition
Complex work at least as demanding as DOK 3, but performed over extended time (days/weeks rather than one sitting).

### Characteristics
- Extended time period allows for original work creation
- Requires metacognitive awareness
- Typically increases complexity overall vs DOK 3
- Requires complex reasoning, planning, research, verification
- Not just repetitive work over time

### Examples

**Long-Term Projects:**
- Conducting research project
- Performance activity
- Experiment
- Design project
- Creating new theorem and proof

**Time as Distinguishing Factor:**
- Extended time is NOT distinguishing if work is only repetitive
- Must require significant conceptual understanding and higher-order thinking
- Example of DOK 2 over time: Collecting daily water temperature for month, graphing results
- Example of DOK 4: Developing mathematical model of river flow for all four seasons using multiple variables

**Connections:**
- Likely requires connections among:
  - Multiple ideas or variables within mathematics
  - Multiple content areas

**Products:**
- Selecting appropriate approach among many alternatives
- Producing product, conclusion, or finding
- Critiquing body of work
- Synthesizing ideas in new way
- Creating original model

## General Guidelines for Assigning DOK

### 1. DOK applies to:
- Mathematics standards
- Tasks
- Activities

### 2. Consider complexity, not difficulty
**Complexity:** Depth of mathematical demands
**Difficulty:** How hard it is for students (depends on student, not content)

### 3. Consider mathematical experience
- Prior knowledge of typical student
- Grade-level expectations
- What would be expected or routine for that grade

### 4. Don't rely on verbs alone
- "Describe," "explain," "evaluate" can be any DOK level
- Consider the content complexity required for adequate response
- Examples:
  - "Describe the steps to add fractions" = DOK 1 (recall)
  - "Describe the mathematical relationship between..." = DOK 2+ (analysis)

### 5. For multiple-choice items
- Consider item as a whole
- Include distractors when judging complexity
- Well-designed distractors can raise DOK level

### 6. Error vs. complexity
- Confusing due to error/wording ≠ increased complexity
- Simply means statement needs revision

## DOK in Into Math TX Context

### Where DOK is Required

**Task 1 Only - DOK Leveled Questions:**
- Level 1: Recall
- Level 2: Basic Application of Skills & Concepts
- Level 3: Strategic Thinking and Complex Reasoning

**Practice on Your Own (POYO) - Item Guide:**
- All items require DOK level assignment (1, 2, or 3)
- DOK 4 not typically used in lesson-level assessments

### DOK Distribution Guidelines

**Recommended balance for assessments:**
- DOK 1: 20-30% (foundational skills)
- DOK 2: 50-60% (application and concepts)
- DOK 3: 15-25% (strategic thinking)
- DOK 4: Rare (project-based, extended work)

### Classification Process

1. **Read the item completely**
   - Include all parts, distractors, scaffolds

2. **Identify what student must DO**
   - Not what they must know
   - The cognitive action required

3. **Consider grade-level expectations**
   - What's routine at this grade?
   - What prior knowledge is expected?

4. **Ask: Is solution path evident?**
   - Yes → Likely DOK 1 or 2
   - No → Likely DOK 3

5. **Check for multiple solution paths**
   - One clear path → DOK 1 or 2
   - Multiple valid approaches → DOK 2 or 3

6. **Verify classification**
   - Read definition again
   - Confirm characteristics match
   - Check examples for similar items

## Common Misclassifications

### Higher Than Actual:

**"Multi-step = higher DOK"** ❌
- Multi-step procedure that's well-defined = DOK 1
- Example: Long division (multiple steps, but routine)

**"Difficult = higher DOK"** ❌
- Large numbers don't increase DOK
- Complexity of thought matters, not difficulty of computation

**"Application = DOK 3"** ❌
- Many applications are DOK 2
- DOK 3 requires non-routine reasoning, not just application

### Lower Than Actual:

**"Simple answer = DOK 1"** ❌
- Simple answer may require complex reasoning
- Example: "Yes/No" answer requiring justification = DOK 2 or 3

**"Familiar context = DOK 1"** ❌
- Familiar context with non-routine approach = DOK 2 or 3
- Context familiarity ≠ routine procedure

**"Multiple choice = DOK 1"** ❌
- Well-designed distractors requiring analysis = DOK 2
- Distractors based on common misconceptions = DOK 2

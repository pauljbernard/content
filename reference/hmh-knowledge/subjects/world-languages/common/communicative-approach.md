# Communicative Language Teaching Approach
**Level:** K-12
**Applies To:** All world languages

---

## Overview

Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) focuses on using language for real communication, not just learning about language rules.

**Key Principle:** "Language is best learned through meaningful use, not grammar drills."

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Meaning Before Accuracy

- Communication is the goal
- Errors are natural part of learning
- Focus on conveying meaning first, refine accuracy over time
- Don't over-correct (kills confidence)

### 2. Authentic Materials and Tasks

- Use real-world texts (menus, articles, videos, songs)
- Tasks mirror real communication (order food, ask directions, write email)
- Not: Textbook dialogues with unnatural language

### 3. Target Language 90%+

- Conduct class in target language (TL) as much as possible
- Students acquire language through comprehensible input
- Use English sparingly (complex grammar explanations, safety issues)

---

## Teaching Strategies

### 1. Comprehensible Input (Krashen)

**Definition:** Language that is slightly beyond current level but understandable through context

**How to Make Input Comprehensible:**
- Use visuals (pictures, realia, gestures)
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Repeat key phrases
- Act out vocabulary
- Use cognates
- Check for understanding frequently

**Example:**
Teaching "weather" vocabulary:
- Show weather images while saying words
- Gesture (shiver for cold, fan self for hot)
- Point to window and describe actual weather
- Have students point to matching images

---

### 2. Three Modes in Every Lesson

Plan activities for all three communication modes:

**Interpretive:** Read restaurant menu (authentic or teacher-created)
**Interpersonal:** Partner conversation: What will you order?
**Presentational:** Describe your ideal restaurant to class

---

### 3. Backwards Design from Can-Do Statements

**Start with:**
"By the end of this unit, students will be able to order food in a restaurant" (Novice High, Interpersonal)

**Then design:**
- Vocabulary and structures needed
- Interpretive input (read menus, watch ordering video)
- Practice activities (dialogues, role-plays)
- Assessment (restaurant role-play IPA)

---

## Instructional Routines

### 1. TPR (Total Physical Response)

**Use for:** Novice learners, vocabulary acquisition, commands

**How:**
1. Teacher models action while saying command: "Stand up" (stands)
2. Students do action with teacher (several repetitions)
3. Teacher says command, students do action
4. Eventually, students give commands to each other

**Best for:** Action verbs, classroom commands, physical descriptions

---

### 2. TPRS (Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling)

**Steps:**
1. Establish meaning of key vocabulary with gestures/visuals
2. Ask story with those words (teacher leads, students contribute)
3. Read story with same vocabulary
4. Retell, act out, discuss

**Benefits:** Comprehensible input, repetition in context, engaging

---

### 3. Information Gap Activities

**Definition:** Partner A has information Partner B needs (and vice versa)

**Example:**
- Partner A has train schedule
- Partner B needs to find time of train to Madrid
- Must communicate in target language to exchange information

**Why effective:** Authentic communication need, negotiation of meaning

---

### 4. Task-Based Learning

**Structure:**
1. **Pre-task:** Introduce topic, activate prior knowledge
2. **Task:** Students complete authentic task in TL (plan trip, solve problem, create product)
3. **Report:** Share results with class
4. **Language Focus:** Highlight useful structures from task

**Example Task:**
"Plan a weekend trip to a Spanish-speaking city. Budget: $500. Present your plan."

---

### 5. Jigsaw Reading/Listening

**Steps:**
1. Divide text/video into parts
2. Each student/group becomes expert on one part
3. Regroup so each new group has one expert from each part
4. Experts teach their part to new group
5. Class reconstructs whole text together

**Benefits:** Accountable talk, peer teaching, comprehensible input from peers

---

## Grammar Teaching in CLT

### NOT: Isolated grammar drills

**Avoid:**
- Conjugation charts divorced from use
- Fill-in-the-blank worksheets
- Grammar as goal itself

---

### YES: Grammar in context

**Approaches:**

**1. Input Flood:**
Provide many examples of structure in comprehensible input before explaining rule.
- Read stories with preterite verbs
- After multiple exposures, students notice pattern
- Then explicitly teach rule

**2. Guided Discovery:**
Students figure out grammar rule from examples.
- Show sentences using "por" vs "para"
- Students identify patterns
- Class formulates rule together

**3. Focus on Form:**
Briefly highlight grammar feature during communicative activity.
- During restaurant role-play, pause to note: "Notice we say 'me gustaría' to politely order"

**4. Error Correction:**
- During fluency activities (Interpersonal): Minimal correction, focus on meaning
- During accuracy activities (Presentational): More correction, but positive
- Use recasts: Student: "I goed" Teacher: "Oh, you went to the store?"

---

## Vocabulary Teaching

### High-Frequency Words First

- Focus on most common words (Novice: ~500 words, Intermediate: 1,000-2,000)
- Thematic vocabulary (family, school, food, travel)
- Personalized vocabulary (students' interests)

---

### Teach in Context

**NOT:** Lists to memorize
**YES:** Words in sentences, stories, authentic materials

**Strategies:**
- Word walls with images
- Picture dictionaries
- Authentic contexts (food vocabulary while "shopping" with realia)
- Cognates (Spanish "familia" = English "family")
- Word families (comprar, compras, comprador, compra)

---

## Cultural Integration

### Cultures Beyond "Foods and Festivals"

**Perspectives:** Why do people in this culture value this?
**Practices:** What do people do? (daily life, traditions, interactions)
**Products:** What does the culture create? (art, literature, architecture, music)

**Example: Día de los Muertos**
- **Product:** Altars with photos, marigolds, sugar skulls
- **Practice:** Families visit graves, share food
- **Perspective:** Death is part of life; honor ancestors; celebrate memories

**Avoid:** Costumes, stereotypes, surface-level treatment

---

### Authentic Cultural Materials

- Songs, films, TV shows
- News articles
- Advertisements
- Social media
- Literature
- Art

---

## Differentiation by Proficiency

### Novice Learners (K-8, Year 1-2 HS)

- Heavy use of visuals and gestures
- Short, simple sentences
- Lots of repetition
- Predictable routines
- TPR, songs, games
- Mostly present tense
- Familiar, concrete topics

---

### Intermediate Learners (Years 3-4 HS, AP Language)

- Longer texts and conversations
- All time frames (past, present, future)
- Abstract and unfamiliar topics
- More student-generated language
- Authentic materials (adapted as needed)
- Cultural comparisons

---

### Advanced Learners (AP Literature, Heritage Speakers)

- Complex authentic texts
- Abstract discussions and writing
- Literary analysis
- Cultural nuances
- Academic language
- Extended discourse

---

## Technology in Language Learning

**Effective Uses:**
- Authentic input (YouTube, podcasts, news sites)
- Communication with native speakers (email, video chat, social media)
- Interactive practice (Duolingo, Quizlet, language apps)
- Creation (videos, podcasts, blogs in TL)

**Caution:** Technology supplements but doesn't replace human interaction and teacher guidance.

## Quick Reference

**Every World Language Lesson Should:**
- ✅ Be conducted 90%+ in target language
- ✅ Include all three modes (Interpretive, Interpersonal, Presentational)
- ✅ Use authentic materials and tasks
- ✅ Focus on meaning and communication (not just grammar)
- ✅ Integrate culture (perspectives, practices, products)
- ✅ Provide comprehensible input (i+1)
- ✅ Align to proficiency level expectations
- ✅ Give students opportunities to USE language, not just study it

**Remember:** Students learn languages by USING them to communicate, not by memorizing rules.

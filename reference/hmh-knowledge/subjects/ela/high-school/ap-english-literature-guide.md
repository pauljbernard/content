## Overview

AP English Literature and Composition is a college-level course focusing on close reading, literary analysis, and interpretation of poetry, prose fiction, and drama. Students engage with sophisticated literary texts, analyze how authors use literary elements and techniques, and develop critical writing skills for literary analysis.

**College/Career Readiness:** AP Lit prepares students for college literature courses, humanities, and critical analysis across disciplines. AP exam scores of 3+ often earn college credit for introductory literature courses. The course develops close reading, analytical thinking, and interpretive writing—skills essential for law, humanities, publishing, education, and any field requiring textual analysis.

**AP Exam:** May exam with multiple-choice section (poetry and prose analysis) and free-response section (poetry analysis, prose fiction analysis, literary argument essays).

## Key Literary Concepts

### 1. Character (CHR)

**Characterization:**
- Direct characterization (author tells us about character)
- Indirect characterization (STEAL: Speech, Thoughts, Effect on others, Actions, Looks)

**Character Types:**
- Protagonist vs. antagonist
- Round vs. flat
- Dynamic (changes) vs. static (doesn't change)
- Archetypal characters

**Character Function:**
- Drive plot forward
- Reveal themes
- Create conflict
- Serve as foil (contrasting character that highlights another's traits)

**Analysis Focus:**
- How does author develop character?
- How does character contribute to meaning?
- How do contrasts between characters create significance?

**See Also:**
- `/subjects/ela/high-school/hs-literature-guide.md` (HS literary elements foundation)

---

### 2. Setting (SET)

**Elements of Setting:**
- Time (historical period, season, time of day)
- Place (geographic location, physical environment)
- Social/cultural context

**Function of Setting:**
- Create mood and atmosphere
- Reflect or contrast with characters' internal states
- Symbolize themes

**Analysis Focus:**

- How does setting contribute to meaning?
- How does setting interact with character and theme?

---

### 3. Structure (STR)

**Elements of Structure:**

- Sentence and paragraph structure (syntax, diction)

**Contrasts and Juxtapositions:**

---

### 4. Narration (NAR)

**Point of View:**

- **Third person limited:** Outside narrator, one character's perspective
- **Third person omniscient:** Outside narrator, all-knowing
- **Multiple narrators:** Shifting perspectives

**Narrator Reliability:**
- Reliable narrator (trustworthy, accurate)

**Function of Narration:**

- Establish tone and perspective
- Reveal character and theme

**Speaker in Poetry:**

**Analysis Focus:**

**Imagery:**

- Creates vivid mental pictures
- Appeals to senses

**Symbolism:**
- Object, character, or event represents abstract idea
- Conventional symbols (light = knowledge, darkness = ignorance)
- Contextual symbols (unique to specific text)

**Irony:**
- **Verbal:** Saying opposite of what is meant (sarcasm)

## AP English Literature Essay Types

### 1. Poetry Analysis (Question 1)

**Prompt Format:**
- Provides poem (often 20th/21st century)
- Asks you to analyze how poet uses literary elements and techniques to convey meaning/develop theme/create effect

**Task:**
- Close read poem
- Identify literary elements and techniques (figurative language, imagery, structure, sound devices, etc.)
- Explain HOW these contribute to meaning/theme/effect

**Essay Structure:**
- Introduction: Introduce poem, poet (if known), thesis about how elements create meaning

- Identify speaker, situation, subject, tone
- Determine theme or central meaning
- Analyze how techniques create this meaning

**Strong Thesis Example:**
> In "The Fish," Elizabeth Bishop uses vivid visual imagery, personification, and a shift in perspective to transform a mundane fishing experience into a revelation about beauty, age, and respect.

**Key Success Strategies:**
- Read poem multiple times
- Don't just identify techniques—analyze FUNCTION and EFFECT
- Integrate short quotations smoothly
- Explain how techniques contribute to meaning

---

### 2. Prose Fiction Analysis (Question 2)

**Prompt Format:**
- Provides prose passage (excerpt from novel or short story)

**Key Success Strategies:**

- Analyze narrative techniques systematically
- Use specific textual evidence
- Explain how techniques create effects

---

### 3. Literary Argument (Question 3)

**Prompt Format:**
- Presents literary concept, theme, or technique
- Provides list of suggested works (or asks you to choose your own)
- Asks you to write essay analyzing how a work of "literary merit" explores this concept

**Task:**
- Choose work you know well (novel, play, epic poem—substantial work)
- Develop claim about how work addresses prompt
- Support with specific textual evidence
- Demonstrate deep knowledge of work

**Essay Structure:**
- Introduction: Introduce work and author, thesis addressing prompt

- Conclusion: Significance or broader implications

**Choosing a Work:**
- Choose work you know VERY well (studied in class, read multiple times)
- Must be "literary merit" (complex, sophisticated, recognized literary value)
- Must fit prompt (don't force a work that doesn't fit)
- Have 3-5 "go-to" works you know deeply

**Strong Thesis Example:**
- Prompt: "In many works, a character's sense of isolation leads to self-discovery."
- Thesis: "In Invisible Man, Ralph Ellison uses the protagonist's literal and metaphorical invisibility—his social isolation as a Black man in mid-20th-century America—to drive his journey from naïveté to radical self-awareness and rejection of imposed identities."

**Key Success Strategies:**
- Choose works strategically (know them deeply)
- Use specific textual evidence (plot details, quotations, character names, etc.)
- Stay focused on prompt (answer the question)
- Demonstrate sophistication (avoid plot summary, analyze significance)

---

## Literary Argument and Close Reading Skills

### Developing a Literary Thesis

**Strong Literary Thesis:**
- Arguable (not just fact or plot summary)
- Specific (focused on particular aspect of text)
- Insightful (reveals meaningful interpretation)
- Addresses prompt directly

**Example:**
- Weak: "The Great Gatsby is about the American Dream." (too broad, obvious)
- Weak: "Gatsby loves Daisy and wants to be with her." (plot summary, not arguable)
- Strong: "Through Gatsby's obsessive pursuit of an idealized past, Fitzgerald reveals the American Dream's transformation from a vision of self-creation to a destructive fantasy fueled by materialism and nostalgia."

---

### Using Textual Evidence

**Types of Evidence:**
- Direct quotations (brief, integrated)
- Paraphrase (summary of plot points or character actions)
- Specific references (character names, symbols, events)

**Integrating Quotations:**
- Introduce context
- Embed quotation smoothly (grammatically)
- Cite correctly (if line numbers or page numbers provided)
- Analyze and explain significance (don't just drop quotes)

**Example:**
> When Fitzgerald describes Daisy's voice as "full of money" (120), he reveals how her allure is inextricable from wealth and class, exposing Gatsby's romantic ideal as fundamentally materialistic.

---

### Line of Reasoning

**Coherent Argument:**
- Each paragraph builds on previous
- Topic sentences connect to thesis
- Transitions show logical progression
- Overall essay develops unified interpretation

---

### Commentary and Analysis

**Commentary:**
- Explain HOW and WHY evidence supports claim
- Analyze techniques and their effects
- Connect evidence to theme/meaning

**Avoid:**
- Plot summary without analysis
- "Laundry list" of devices without explaining function
- Stating obvious without interpretation

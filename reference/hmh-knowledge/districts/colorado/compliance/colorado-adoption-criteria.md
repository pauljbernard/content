# Colorado Adoption Criteria
**State Board of Education Requirements**
**Source:** Colorado Department of Education (CDE)
**Applies To:** All Colorado instructional materials (all subjects)

---

## Overview

**Colorado uses local control for curriculum adoption** with state oversight through CDE. All materials must align to Colorado Academic Standards and support English Learners.

## Key Facts

| Aspect | Colorado |
|--------|----------|
| **Content Standards** | Colorado Academic Standards (CAS) - CCSS-based |
| **Language Standards** | CO ELD Standards (state-specific) |
| **Adoption Process** | Local district control |
| **Compliance** | CDE guidance |
| **Science Standards** | Colorado Science Standards (NGSS-based) |
| **Assessment** | CMAS (Colorado Measures of Academic Success) |
| **EL Assessment** | WIDA ACCESS (but not full WIDA consortium) |

## Colorado Academic Standards (CAS)

**Mathematics:** Colorado Academic Standards for Mathematics (based on CCSS-M, 90%+ aligned)

**ELA:** Colorado Academic Standards for Reading, Writing, and Communicating (based on CCSS-ELA)

**Science:** Colorado Science Standards (based on NGSS)

---

## English Learner Support

**Colorado uses state-specific ELD standards:**
- Colorado English Language Development Standards
- Uses WIDA ACCESS assessment (but has own ELD standards framework)
- 5 proficiency levels (Level 1 → Level 5, Bridged)

**Unique:** Uses WIDA assessment but CO-specific ELD standards

**See:** `/districts/colorado/language/colorado-eld-standards.md` for complete guidance

---

## Knowledge Reuse (90-95%)

**Reused:** CCSS-M (90%+ aligned), NGSS, MLRs, universal frameworks

**CO-Specific:** Colorado Academic Standards modifications, CO ELD framework

---

## Implementation Notes

**Standards:** CAS.Math.5.NF.A.1 ≈ CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.A.1 (minor differences)

**Language:** CO ELD 5 proficiency levels, WIDA ACCESS assessment

**Assessment:** CMAS for Math/ELA/Science

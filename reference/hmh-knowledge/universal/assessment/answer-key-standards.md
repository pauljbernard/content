# Answer Key Standards
**Quality Standards for Assessment Answer Keys**
**Scope:** Universal (all subjects and districts)
**Audience:** Curriculum developers and assessment authors

---

## Overview

**Answer keys are critical instructional tools** that must be accurate, complete, and helpful for teachers. All assessment items require properly formatted answer keys that enable consistent scoring.

**Core Principle:** A well-crafted answer key supports accurate scoring, provides instructional insights, and builds teacher confidence.

## Answer Key Format by Item Type

### Multiple Choice (Single Select):

```
Question 15

Correct Answer: B (24 square units)

Scoring: 1 point

Standard: 5.4G - Area of rectangles

DOK: 2

Rationale:
A (20 units) - Calculated perimeter instead of area
B (24 square units) - CORRECT: 6 × 4 = 24 square units
C (28 square units) - Added dimensions instead of multiplying
D (10 square units) - Only counted one dimension
```

---

### Multiple Choice (Multiple Response):

```
Question 8

Correct Answers: A, C, E (all three required for full credit)

Scoring: 1 point for all three correct; 0 points otherwise

Standard: 6.2B - Identify factors

DOK: 1

Rationale:
A (2) - CORRECT: 2 is a factor of 24
B (5) - Incorrect: 5 is not a factor of 24
C (6) - CORRECT: 6 is a factor of 24
D (7) - Incorrect: 7 is not a factor of 24
E (8) - CORRECT: 8 is a factor of 24
```

---

### Fill in the Blank (Numerical):

```
Question 3

Correct Answers: 0.75, 3/4, 75%, 6/8 (any equivalent form)

Scoring: 1 point

Standard: 5.3K - Equivalent fractions and decimals

DOK: 1

Note: Accept any mathematically equivalent representation. Learnosity
configured with equivSymbolic validation to accept all forms.
```

---

### Short Answer (Text):

```
Question 12

Correct Answer: The remainder represents 3 extra cookies that cannot fill
a complete box. Since we need to package all cookies, we need 6 boxes total
(not 5).

Scoring: 2 points (see rubric)

Rubric:
2 points - Correctly interprets remainder in context (need 6 boxes) with
clear explanation

1 point - Identifies remainder but incomplete or unclear interpretation,
OR correct interpretation without explanation

0 points - Incorrect interpretation or no response

Standard: 4.4G - Division with remainders in context

DOK: 3

Sample Responses:
- 2 points: "The remainder is 3 cookies. Since we can't leave any out,
we need one more box. The answer is 6 boxes."

- 1 point: "There are 3 left over. We need more boxes." (identifies
remainder but incomplete interpretation)

- 0 points: "The answer is 5 R3." (no interpretation of remainder in context)
```

---

### Essay/Extended Response:

```
Question 5

Scoring: 2 points (see rubric)

Rubric:
2 points - Provides complete explanation of strategy with accurate work
shown and clear mathematical reasoning using appropriate vocabulary

1 point - Provides partial explanation with some work shown, OR correct
work without adequate explanation, OR minor computational error with sound
reasoning

0 points - Incorrect work with no sound reasoning, or no response

Standard: 6.3C - Represent integer operations

DOK: 3

Exemplar 2-Point Response:
"I used a number line to show -3 + 5. I started at -3 and moved 5 units
to the right because adding positive means moving right. I ended at positive
2. So -3 + 5 = 2."

[Include visual of number line if student drew one]

Exemplar 1-Point Response:
"I got 2 by counting." (correct answer but insufficient explanation)

Exemplar 0-Point Response:
"I think it's -8." (incorrect with no valid reasoning)
```

---

## Special Considerations

### Accepting Equivalent Forms:

**Always accept mathematically equivalent answers:**

**Fractions:**
- Question asks for "simplified form" → Accept only 3/4
- Question doesn't specify → Accept 3/4, 6/8, 75/100, etc.

**Decimals:**
- 0.5 = 0.50 = 0.500 (trailing zeros acceptable)
- Round to nearest tenth specified → Only accept one decimal place

**Expressions:**
- 2x + 6 = 2(x + 3) = 6 + 2x (equivalent algebraic forms)

**Percentages:**
- 75% = 0.75 = 3/4 (accept unless format specified)

---

### Units and Labels:

**When units are part of correct answer:**
- Question stem indicates context → Units required
- "How many inches?" → Answer must include "inches"
- Pure computation → Units optional unless specified

**Example:**
- Question: "What is the area?" with diagram → Accept "24 square units" OR "24 sq. units" OR "24 units²"
- Question: "Calculate 12 × 2" → Accept "24" (no unit required)

---

### Rounding and Precision:

**Specify rounding expectations clearly:**

**In Question Stem:**
"Round to the nearest hundredth."

**In Answer Key:**
```
Correct Answer: 12.57

Note: Must be rounded to exactly two decimal places. Do not accept 12.6 or 12.567.
```

---

### Multiple Solution Methods:

**For open-ended problems, acknowledge valid approaches:**

```
Question: "Solve 125 ÷ 5. Show your thinking."

Acceptable Solution Methods:
Method 1 - Long Division: Shows long division algorithm (answer: 25)
Method 2 - Repeated Subtraction: Subtracts 5 repeatedly until reaching 0
Method 3 - Skip Counting: Counts by 5s up to 125 (25 times)
Method 4 - Multiplication Relationship: Thinks 5 × ? = 125

All methods acceptable if executed correctly and clearly explained.
```

## Common Answer Key Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Accepting Only One Form

**Problem:**
Answer Key: "3/4 only"
Student writes: "6/8"
Teacher marks wrong (but 6/8 = 3/4!)

**Fix:** Accept all equivalent forms unless question specifies simplified form.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Missing Sample Responses

**Problem:**
Constructed response item with rubric but no examples
Teachers struggle to apply rubric consistently

**Fix:** Provide 2-point, 1-point, and 0-point exemplars

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Vague Partial Credit Rules

**Problem:**
"1 point for partial credit"
What earns partial credit?

**Fix:** Specify scenarios: "1 point if setup correct but computation error, OR correct answer without work shown"

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: No Distractor Rationale

**Problem:**
Multiple choice answer key only shows correct answer
Teachers can't help students understand misconceptions

**Fix:** Explain why each distractor is wrong and what misconception it represents

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Incomplete Equivalent List

**Problem:**
Answer key accepts "0.5, 1/2" but student writes "50%"
Teacher unsure if acceptable

**Fix:** List all reasonable equivalents or use "any equivalent form"

- Use `equivSymbolic` for mathematical equivalence
- Test with multiple valid formats

**Manually-Scored Items:**
- Include complete rubric in teacher view
- Provide anchor responses for each score point
- Enable teacher annotation tools

---

### Answer Key in Item Bank:

**Metadata Fields:**
- `correct_answer`: Stores answer value
- `scoring_type`: "automatic" or "manual"
- `rubric`: Full rubric text
- `rationale`: Explanation of correct/incorrect
- `sample_responses`: Array of examples

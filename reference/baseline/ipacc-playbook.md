## IPACC Guide

# Spec Writing Playbook for Into Math TX

### Purpose & Scope

This playbook instructs an LXD or Vendor how to draft clear, compliant,
and production‑ready specs for Photos, Illustrative Art, Tech Art, and
Hybrid assets in the Math/IPACC pipeline. It consolidates guidance from
three internal sources and aims to:

-   Convey precise creative intent so researchers, artists, and photo
    teams can execute on the first pass.

-   Select the correct asset type.

-   Integrate Texas SBOE Suitability Requirements and accessibility from
    the start

### Asset Types & How to Classify

-   **Asset Types (print program):** Photos, Illustrative Art, Tech Art.
    Use "Images" as a collective term.

-   **Tech Art:** instructional tools (charts, graphs, manipulatives,
    shapes, measuring devices). If it functions as a teaching tool,
    classify as Tech Art.

-   **Simple Illustrative Art:** common
    objects/animals/food/plants/posters and other simple visuals. Some
    live in the Tech Art Library for convenience.

-   **Photography types:** 3rd‑Party (Stock) and New Assignment (Photo
    Studio). Choose studio when custom context/models/props/angles are
    critical to the learning objective.

-   **Hybrid:** Tech Art that embeds new/modified art or a photo.
    Include a full art/photo spec and state it will be used inside Tech
    Art.

### Core Spec‑Writing Principles (applies to all asset types)

-   State the objective clearly ("The purpose is to show...") so the
    learning intent is obvious.

-   List must‑have elements vs. discretionary elements (what can be left
    to artist/photographer judgment).

-   Assume no background content knowledge---write so a new contributor
    could execute from the spec alone.

-   Provide reference scrap, especially for Art & Studio specs
    (screenshots/quick sketches/links). **Manuscripts** of the content
    to illustrate what we need to replicate helps us understand exactly
    what\'s needed and reduces uncertainty/time spent in escalation.

-   Use sufficient but not excessive detail---enough to meet the
    objective while allowing inclusive selection and creative latitude.

-   Be sure grade level is clear and include age range of any people.
    Our style is to skew a little older than the target grade, so kids
    don\'t feel something is \"babyish\". We also need a range of adult
    ages for diversity.

### Writing Specs by Asset Type

### Photo Specs {#photo-specs .Callout-Heading}

**Minimum information:**

-   **Objective:** One sentence describing what the image must
    teach/show.

-   **Content Description:** People/no people; if people: how many,
    age/grade, ethnicity, full/partial body, indoor/outdoor, setting,
    posed/candid. Items/props (and any safety gear). Domain specifics
    (e.g., scientific process/species). Clarifying keywords ("service
    dog" vs "dog").

-   **Reference Scrap:** Provide links or thumbnails; mark as
    reference‑only.

-   **DEI/CEID & Accessibility:** Ensure equitable representation of all
    categories.

**Photo Studio add‑ons:**

-   Location (e.g., kitchen, classroom, specific city/season).

-   Time of day (day/night/dusk/sunset).

-   Models (ages/grades; parent/teacher presence; ethnicity as needed
    for counts).

-   Props & wardrobe/safety gear.

-   Camera angle/perspective tied to the learning objective (e.g., low
    angle to reveal gravity).

**Spec writing best practices (photos):**

-   Add an explicit objective when in doubt.

-   No famous people; avoid shots/angles that expose anatomy/skin
    inappropriately; specify apparatus/context for sports.

-   Avoid famous artwork and stamps for potential secondary clearances

### Illustrative Art Specs {#illustrative-art-specs .Callout-Heading}

**Minimum information:**

-   **Objective** (what the art must teach/show).

-   **Must‑have elements** (objects, characters, labels, etc.). State
    any element that must appear a specific way.

-   **Discretionary elements** (what the artist can decide).

-   **People specifics (if present):** ethnicity, gender, age in the
    description for demographic balance.

-   **Map‑specifics (if applicable):** objective/end‑goal; projection,
    scale, source line, legend, and legend data.

-   **Reference Scrap** (links, sketches, screenshots)---reference only.

**Background specification (always address):**

-   Silhouette (isolated objects, no background).

-   Background (e.g., park backdrop; make sure it does not compete with
    focal content).

-   Sky (day/night; cloudy/clear; whether sun is visible).

    **Pickup/Reuse ("PU") specs must include:**

-   Start description with "Pick‑up" or "PU".

-   Book title & grade; page number (if from print).

-   General description of the art/map to pick up.

-   Visual screenshot of the target art/map as scrap.

### Tech Art Specs {#tech-art-specs .Callout-Heading}

**Minimum fields the AI must produce for Tech Art:**

-   **Header:** Date, Your Initials, Grade level.

-   **Spec description** (thorough; "the more information the better").

-   **Include scrap:** pattern size when applicable.

-   If Hybrid (embedding new/modified art or photo), include a full
    art/photo spec and state it will be included in Tech Art.

### When to use Photo vs Illustrative Art vs Tech Art {#when-to-use-photo-vs-illustrative-art-vs-tech-art .Callout-Heading}

**Quick decision flow**

1.  Is the visual primarily a teaching tool/diagram (charts, graphs,
    manipulatives, shapes, measuring devices, mathematical
    patterns/markups)? → **Tech Art**.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Does learning require real‑world authenticity (people, places,
    props, emotion, texture, realistic context, time of day/season, or a
    specific species/process)? → **Photo**. If stock cannot meet the
    precise objective or demographic needs, plan a Photo Studio shot.

2.  Do you need total control over what appears (to avoid brands, to
    simplify/idealize, to label/map, or to depict an impossible/special
    view)? → **Illustrative Art**.

3.  Are you embedding art or a photo inside a teaching diagram? →
    **Hybrid Tech Art** (write a full art/photo spec and note it will be
    included in Tech Art).

**All asset types must meet DEI/CEID and accessibility requirements
(representation, language, safety, nutrition, no brands/logos
prominence, etc.).**

**Use Photo when...**

-   The instructional goal relies on realism: authentic settings, props,
    or human interaction (e.g., a poll being conducted; a gymnast on
    beam/bars/vault).

-   The concept is shown by angle/perspective or motion that a camera
    captures intuitively (e.g., low, level angle to make gravity visible
    with food falling into a bowl).

-   You need specific demographics/ages and naturalistic scenes
    (indoor/outdoor, posed/not posed, day/night, season, city), with
    explicit model/prop control via studio.

-   A real species/process must be pictured correctly (science tie‑ins).

*Good fits (illustrative examples)*

-   "Show one way a poll is conducted" in a public square with diverse
    adults; round inset. (Stock or Studio.)

-   "Female artistic gymnast performing on apparatus"; scoreboard ideal
    but optional. (Stock or Studio.)

**Use Illustrative Art when...**

-   You need precise control over what appears and how---to avoid
    incidental brands/logos, to simplify complexity, or to show an
    idealized or impossible view.

-   The objective depends on labels, callouts, legends, or a map with
    specific projection/scale/source line/legend data.

-   You want consistent style across many images or grades, or you must
    standardize backgrounds (silhouette, simple background, or sky
    conditions) so the focus stays on the math.

-   You're picking up/reusing existing art and need to match or modify
    it predictably. (Begin description with PU/Pick‑up, include
    title/grade/page and a screenshot.)

*Good fits (illustrative examples)*

-   Counting animals at a zoo with exact ages/ethnicities and urban
    backdrop---where you control what's visible and how busy the scene
    is.

-   A map that must include projection, scale, legend, and source line.

**Use Tech Art when...**

-   The visual is a teaching tool: charts, graphs, manipulatives,
    shapes, measuring devices, math patterns/diagrams, or other
    structured math visuals.

-   You need standardized, pre‑made math visuals from the Tech Art
    Library (note: the library may also contain frequently used simple
    illustrative art and currency for convenience). Choose based on
    function, not storage location.

-   The spec is for a static pattern or geometric construction with
    exact labeling and dimensions (include date/initials/grade, pattern
    size, and scrap).

**Hybrid Tech Art**

-   When Tech Art includes new/modified art or a photo, write a full
    spec for that embedded asset and state that it will be included in
    Tech Art.

*Good fits (illustrative examples)*

-   "StaticPattern_A triangle whose base is extended; label angles as
    specified." (Include date/initials/grade, pattern size, and scrap.)

-   A manipulative diagram, measurement setup, coordinate grid, or
    fraction model.

**Edge cases & tie‑breakers**

-   Simple objects/foods/animals sometimes live in the Tech Art Library
    for convenience. Still classify by intent: if it's a teaching
    diagram, it's Tech Art; if it's a general object/scene illustration,
    it's Illustrative Art.

-   If brand/logo risk or nutrition restrictions are hard to control in
    photography, prefer Illustrative Art (you can design neutral
    packaging/foods per guidance).

-   If the core goal is DEI balance in a realistic context (varied ages,
    ethnicities, roles, emotions), Photo can be the most authentic---but
    ensure it still satisfies CEID counts and avoids restricted content.

### Accessibility & "Knockout Text"

-   Avoid knockout text that reduces legibility.

-   Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background/illustration
    colors.

### Quick Checks for the LXD(v) to Follow

1.  Classify the asset type (Photo vs Illustrative Art vs Tech Art vs
    Hybrid).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
4.  Draft the objective in one sentence tied to the learning outcome.

5.  Populate required fields by asset type, including scrap when
    relevant.

6.  Apply Texas SBOE Suitability Requirements & accessibility checks

7.  Eliminate restricted content (brands/logos; unsafe practices;
    low‑nutrition foods; glamorized substances)

8.  Self‑check: "Could I draw/shoot this from the spec alone?" If not,
    add detail or scrap.

### Spec Examples

-   **Angle for learning objective (Studio Photo):** Pouring dog food
    into a bowl with dog; low, level angle to reveal gravity (food
    falling into the bowl).

-   **Polling scene (Photo):** Adult (any gender) polling 2--3
    ethnically diverse adults in an outdoor public square; clipboard
    visible; round inset; audience engaged; objective: show one way a
    poll is conducted.

-   **Gymnastics (Photo):** Female artistic gymnast on balance
    beam/parallel bars/vault; scoreboard ideal but optional; no famous
    people; avoid angles that show anatomy/skin.

-   **Zoo counting (Illustrative Art):** 8‑year‑old Asian boy with
    mid‑30s Asian mother at an urban zoo; looking at giraffes; light
    foliage; attach reference scrap.

-   **Triangle pattern (Tech Art):** 05.09.2024, RP, G8: StaticPattern_A
    triangle with extended base; follow angle‑labeling specifications;
    see sketch (scrap).

### Texas SBOE Suitability Requirements

**How to Use These Guidelines**

-   Apply these standards to all image specifications in instructional
    materials for Texas K--12 adoption.

**General Prohibitions**

-   No Common Core References: Images must not reference, imply, or
    visually align with Common Core State Standards. Use Texas Essential
    Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) terminology and concepts only.

-   No Harmful, Obscene, or Vulgar Content: Images must not contain
    material that is harmful, obscene, pervasively vulgar, or
    educationally unsuitable for minors. This includes sexual, violent,
    or prurient imagery.

-   No Sexually Explicit or Relevant Material: Do not include images
    that depict or allude to sexual conduct, nudity, or reproductive
    health topics, except where required by TEKS and presented in an
    age-appropriate, factual manner.

-   No Promotion of Abortion: Images must not promote or encourage
    abortion as a pregnancy option.

**2. Equity and Non-Discrimination**

-   No Superiority or Discrimination: Images must not suggest that one
    race or sex is superior, or that individuals are inherently racist,
    sexist, or oppressive due to their race or sex.

-   No Attribution of Blame: Do not imply that individuals bear
    responsibility or guilt for actions committed by others of the same
    race or sex.

-   No Meritocracy as Oppression: Avoid images that imply meritocracy or
    work ethic are racist or oppressive.

**3. Historical Accuracy**

-   No 1619 Project Content: Do not include images or visual references
    developed through or perpetuating concepts from the 1619 Project.
    Depict the founding of the United States in relation to the
    Declaration of Independence (1776), not the arrival of enslaved
    Africans in 1619.

-   Slavery and Racism: Images should honestly address the history of
    slavery and racism as deviations from American founding principles
    of liberty and equality, not as defining features.

**4. Violence and Civil Order**

-   No Sensational Violence: If violence is depicted, it must be
    contextualized (cause and consequence), not presented for excitement
    or sensationalism.

-   No Encouragement of Disorder: Images must not encourage or condone
    civil disorder, social strife, or disregard for the law. Historical
    examples (e.g., peaceful protests) may be depicted objectively.

**5. Parental Rights**

-   Respect Parental Authority: Images must not contradict the right of
    parents to direct the moral and religious training of their
    children. Avoid visuals that undermine parental involvement in
    sensitive topics.

**6. Political Neutrality**

-   No Forced Political Activity: Do not include images that promote or
    require political activism, lobbying, or advocacy for social/public
    policy. No extra credit or grades should be tied to such activities.

-   Balanced Representation: When depicting debated topics, images must
    present multiple perspectives objectively, without favoring any
    political ideology.

**7. Sexual Risk Avoidance (If Applicable)**

-   Abstinence Emphasis: For materials including human sexuality
    instruction, images must present abstinence as the preferred choice
    and devote more attention to abstinence than other behaviors.

-   Contraception: If contraception or condom use is depicted, images
    must reflect real-world use rates, not theoretical laboratory rates.

**8. Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) Compliance**

-   No Obscene or Harmful Visuals: Digital images must be free of
    obscene, pornographic, or harmful content. No visuals should hint at
    sexually explicit conduct, especially involving minors.

-   Age Appropriateness: All images must be suitable for the intended
    audience's maturity level.

-   External Resources: Linked or referenced online images must be
    pre-screened for CIPA compliance.

**9. Escalation Protocol**

-   Flagging Issues: If any new or existing image content could be
    construed as leaning toward prohibited areas, escalate immediately
    to the designated reviewers

### 

### Special Content Limits to Enforce

-   **Brands/logos:** exclude unless educational purpose requires and
    cannot be achieved otherwise; if unavoidable, avoid prominence and
    apply same caution in text.

-   **Unsafe/inhumane depictions:** exclude unsafe lab practices,
    unsupervised sharp tools, frayed wiring; never condone
    violence/inhumane treatment; historical inhumanity may be included
    appropriately.

-   **Substances:** never glamorize; if non‑incidental, include hazard
    context.

-   **Nutrition visuals:** Reinforce nutritious foods and exercise;
    minimize low‑nutrition foods.

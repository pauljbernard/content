# Illinois Adoption Criteria
**State Board of Education Requirements**
**Source:** Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE)
**Applies To:** All Illinois instructional materials (all subjects)

---

## Overview

**Illinois uses local control for curriculum adoption** with state oversight through ISBE. There is no formal statewide textbook adoption process. All materials must align to Illinois Learning Standards (ILS) and support English Learners.

**Core Principle:** Materials must align to state learning standards (CCSS-based), support English Learners, provide accessibility, and demonstrate quality instructional design.

## Key Facts

| Aspect | Illinois |
|--------|----------|
| **Content Standards** | Illinois Learning Standards (ILS) - CCSS-based |
| **Language Standards** | English Learners (WIDA consortium) |
| **Adoption Process** | Local district control |
| **Compliance** | ISBE guidance, no formal review |
| **Science Standards** | Illinois Learning Standards for Science (NGSS-based) |
| **Assessment** | SAT (high school), IAR (3-8), ISA (science) |
| **EL Assessment** | ACCESS for ELLs (WIDA) |

## Illinois Learning Standards (ILS)

### Content Standards:

**Mathematics:**
- Illinois Learning Standards for Mathematics
- Based on CCSS-M with Illinois clarifications
- Nearly identical to CCSS-M (95%+ alignment)

**ELA:**
- Illinois Learning Standards for English Language Arts
- Based on CCSS-ELA
- Emphasis on college and career readiness

**Science:**
- Illinois Learning Standards for Science (2016)
- Based on NGSS framework
- Three-dimensional learning (DCIs, SEPs, CCCs)

**Social Science:**
- Illinois Learning Standards for Social Science
- Incorporates C3 Framework

---

## English Learner Support

### WIDA Consortium Member:

**Illinois uses WIDA standards:**
- World-Class Instructional Design and Assessment
- Consortium of 40+ states
- ACCESS for ELLs assessment
- 6 proficiency levels (1.0 Entering → 6.0 Reaching)

**WIDA English Language Development Standards:**
- Standard 1: Social and Instructional Language
- Standard 2: Language of Language Arts
- Standard 3: Language of Mathematics
- Standard 4: Language of Science
- Standard 5: Language of Social Studies

**See Also:** For WIDA scaffold guidance, materials use same strategies as ELD/ELPS but reference WIDA levels

---

## Local Adoption Process

**Illinois districts independently evaluate and adopt materials:**

**Typical District Criteria:**
- Alignment to Illinois Learning Standards
- Support for English Learners (WIDA)
- Assessment quality
- Digital-print integration
- Cost and professional development
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**State Assessments Influence Decisions:**
- IAR (Illinois Assessment of Readiness) - Grades 3-8 Math/ELA
- ISA (Illinois Science Assessment) - Grades 5, 8, 11
- SAT - Grade 11 (college readiness indicator)

---

## Knowledge Reuse

### ✅ Reused from Universal/Common (95%):

- **DOK Framework** - Universal
- **MLR (Mathematical Language Routines)** - Subject-common
- **Assessment guidelines** - Universal
- **UDL Principles** - Universal
- **Accessibility** - Universal
- **CCSS-M Alignment** - Reuse CA file (95% identical)
- **NGSS Alignment** - Reuse common file (95% identical)

### 🔧 Illinois-Specific (5%):

- **WIDA EL Standards** - Different from CA ELD / TX ELPS
- **Local Adoption Context** - District-level decisions
- **Illinois branding** - "Illinois Learning Standards" not "CCSS"

---

## Implementation Notes

### When Creating Illinois Math Lessons:

**Content Standards:**
- Tag with Illinois Learning Standards codes
- Example: IL.Math.5.NF.A.1 (equivalent to CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.A.1)
- **Practical:** Use CCSS-M tags with note "Adopted in IL as IL.Math.[code]"

**Language Support:**
- Reference WIDA ELD Standards
- Use MLRs (same as all states - math common)
- Provide scaffolds for WIDA proficiency levels (1.0-6.0, commonly grouped as 1-2, 3-4, 5-6)

**Assessment:**
- Same item types as other states (universal)
- IAR alignment for grades 3-8

---

## Knowledge Resolution Example

**Scenario:** Creating HMH Math IL Lesson 5.3

**Knowledge Needed:**
1. CCSS-M standards → `/subjects/mathematics/districts/california/ccss-m-alignment.md` (reused!)
2. MLR6 → `/subjects/mathematics/common/mlr/mlr6-three-reads.md` (reused!)
3. DOK Framework → `/universal/frameworks/dok-framework.md` (reused!)
4. WIDA Support → `/districts/illinois/language/illinois-el-standards.md` (IL-specific)
5. Assessment → `/universal/assessment/` (reused!)

**Result:** Only 1-2 IL-specific files; 95%+ knowledge reused!

---

## Illinois Context

**Geographic Coverage:**
- Chicago Public Schools (CPS): 350,000 students (largest district)
- Suburban districts: Collar counties (Cook, DuPage, Lake, Kane, Will)
- Downstate: Rural and small-city districts

**Diversity:**
- Highly diverse urban areas (Chicago)
- Significant EL population (150+ languages in CPS)
- Rural districts with different needs

## Quick Reference

### Illinois-Specific Files:
- `illinois-adoption-criteria.md` - This file
- `illinois-el-standards.md` - WIDA EL standards

### Reused Files (~20 files):
- CCSS-M, NGSS alignments
- All MLR files (8 files)
- All assessment files (8 files)
- Universal frameworks (DOK, UDL, EB scaffolding)

**Total:** ~2 new files, ~20 files reused (90-95% reuse)

**Remember:** Illinois uses CCSS-based standards (rebranded as Illinois Learning Standards) and WIDA EL standards. The vast majority (95%+) of content guidance is reused from existing CCSS/NGSS files. Only WIDA-specific language scaffolds require new documentation.

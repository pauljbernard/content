## Primary Source Analysis Framework

**1. Observe**
- What do you notice first?
- What people and objects are shown?
- What is the physical setting?
- What, if any, words do you see?

**2. Reflect**
- What is the source (document, photograph, artifact)?
- Who created it and when?
- Why was it created?
- Who was the audience?

**3. Question**
- What do you wonder about? What confuses you?
- What would you want to know more about?
- What questions does this source raise?

**4. Conclude**
- What did you learn from examining this source?
- What conclusions can you draw?
- What questions remain unanswered?

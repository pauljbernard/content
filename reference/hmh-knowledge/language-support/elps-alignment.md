# ELPS Alignment Guide for Mathematics
**English Language Proficiency Standards for Texas**
**Source:** Texas Administrative Code (TAC) §74.4
**Audience:** Curriculum developers creating Texas-compliant content
**Status:** Required for all Texas instructional materials

---

## Overview

**ELPS (English Language Proficiency Standards)** are Texas state standards that specify how to support Emergent Bilinguals (EBs) across all content areas. Every mathematics lesson in Texas materials **must explicitly align to and support ELPS.**

**Core Principle:** Emergent Bilinguals develop English proficiency while learning grade-level mathematics content—not after or instead of.

---

## Legal Requirement

### Texas Education Code:

**TAC §74.4(a):**
"School districts shall identify the level of English language proficiency of each English learner in the following domains: reading, writing, speaking, and listening."

**TAC §74.4(b):**
"School districts shall provide English learners with instruction that is linguistically accommodated and based on the English language proficiency standards."

### SBOE Adoption Requirement:

Materials must demonstrate:
- Explicit ELPS alignment at lesson and activity level
- Linguistic accommodations for all four domains
- Scaffolds for Emerging, Expanding, and Bridging levels
- Integration of language and content objectives

**Consequence:** Materials without ELPS alignment will NOT be adopted in Texas.

---

## The ELPS Framework

### Four Language Domains:

**1. Listening (ELPS 1.C, 2.C-E, 3.E-F)**
- Comprehend spoken mathematical discourse
- Follow oral directions
- Listen to peer explanations
- Understand teacher modeling

**2. Speaking (ELPS 1.D-F, 2.C-I, 3.B-F)**
- Explain mathematical thinking orally
- Discuss strategies with partners
- Ask and answer questions
- Present solutions

**3. Reading (ELPS 1.A-E, 2.A-E, 4.A-K)**
- Comprehend word problems
- Read mathematical text and directions
- Understand graphs, tables, and visual displays
- Derive meaning from mathematical vocabulary

**4. Writing (ELPS 1.C, 2.C-G, 5.A-G)**
- Write explanations and justifications
- Show work with labels
- Create mathematical representations
- Use symbols and notation

---

### Three Proficiency Levels:

**Beginning/Emerging:**
- New to English (0-2 years in U.S. schools typically)
- Limited English vocabulary
- May understand more than they can express
- Need heavy linguistic support

**Intermediate/Expanding:**
- Developing English proficiency (2-4 years typically)
- Growing vocabulary
- Can communicate in simple sentences
- Need moderate linguistic support

**Advanced/Advanced High/Bridging:**
- Near grade-level English proficiency
- Strong vocabulary in many contexts
- Can communicate complex ideas
- Need light linguistic support

---

## How to Align Lessons to ELPS

### Step 1: Identify Language Demands

For each lesson, determine:

**Listening Demands:**
- Must students comprehend oral directions?
- Will teacher model thinking aloud?
- Will students listen to peer explanations?

**Speaking Demands:**
- Must students explain thinking orally?
- Will students discuss with partners?
- Will students present to class?

**Reading Demands:**
- Are there word problems to read?
- Must students read directions?
- Are there graphs or tables to interpret?

**Writing Demands:**
- Must students write explanations?
- Should students show and label work?
- Will students create representations?

---

### Step 2: Select Applicable ELPS SEs

Choose 2-4 ELPS SEs that match the language demands.

**Example Lesson:** Students solve word problems and explain strategies to partners.

**Language Demands:**
- Reading: Comprehend word problem
- Speaking: Explain thinking
- Listening: Understand partner's strategy
- Writing: Show work

**Applicable ELPS:**
- **4.F** - Use visual and contextual supports to read text (word problem)
- **3.E** - Share information in cooperative learning interactions (partner discussion)
- **5.G** - Narrate, describe, and explain with increasing specificity (written explanation)
- **2.I** - Demonstrate listening comprehension (listen to partner)

---

### Step 3: Design Linguistic Accommodations

For each ELPS SE, provide specific support:

**For ELPS 4.F (Reading word problem):**
- Include visual image with word problem
- Bold key information
- Provide vocabulary glossary

**For ELPS 3.E (Partner discussion):**
- Provide sentence frames
- Allow think time before speaking
- Model discussion with student volunteer

**For ELPS 5.G (Written explanation):**
- Provide sentence starters
- Allow drawing + labels
- Display example explanation

**For ELPS 2.I (Listening to partner):**
- Teach active listening strategies
- Provide listening checklist
- Allow partner to repeat/rephrase

---

### Step 4: Differentiate by Proficiency Level

Adjust supports based on student level:

**Emerging:**
- Heavy scaffolding (extensive sentence frames, vocabulary lists, visuals)
- Accept native language + English mix
- Accept gestures, drawings, single words

**Expanding:**
- Moderate scaffolding (sentence frames, key vocabulary)
- Encourage complete sentences
- Accept simple sentence structures

**Bridging:**
- Light scaffolding (optional sentence frames)
- Expect complex sentences
- Push for precise vocabulary

---

### Step 5: Document ELPS Alignment

In lesson materials, explicitly state:

**Format:**
```
ELPS Alignment:
• ELPS 4.F - Visual and contextual supports provided for word problem comprehension
• ELPS 3.E - Sentence frames and cooperative learning protocols support partner sharing
• ELPS 5.G - Sentence starters and exemplars scaffold written explanations
• ELPS 2.I - Active listening strategies taught; students restate partner's ideas
```

## Common ELPS Alignment Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Listing ELPS without Explanation
**Problem:** "ELPS: 1.A, 3.E, 4.F, 5.G" (no description)
**Impact:** Teachers don't know what to do
**Fix:** Explain alignment: "ELPS 3.E - Sentence frames support partner discussions about strategies"

### ❌ Mistake 2: Generic Accommodations
**Problem:** "Provide support for EBs" (vague)
**Impact:** No actionable guidance
**Fix:** "Provide sentence frames: 'I solved it by ___. First I ___. Then I ___.'"

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Differentiation
**Problem:** Same support for Emerging and Bridging
**Impact:** Not responsive to proficiency levels
**Fix:** Differentiate: Emerging (extensive frames), Expanding (moderate frames), Bridging (optional frames)

### ❌ Mistake 4: ELPS as Afterthought
**Problem:** ELPS section at end, disconnected from lesson
**Impact:** Feels like add-on, not integrated
**Fix:** Embed ELPS support throughout lesson activities

### ❌ Mistake 5: Ignoring Domains
**Problem:** Only speaking addressed, no reading/writing/listening
**Impact:** Incomplete language development
**Fix:** Address all four domains across lesson and unit

---

## ELPS + Texas Compliance

### ELPS is Part of:

**SBOE Quality Rubric:**
- Component 6: Supports for Special Populations
- EBs must have explicit linguistic accommodations

**IPACC Review:**
- Materials must demonstrate ELPS alignment
- Linguistic accommodations must be present

**Vendor Checklist:**
- ELPS SEs documented at lesson level
- Scaffolds differentiated by proficiency level

**Consequence:**
Without ELPS alignment, materials WILL NOT be adopted in Texas.

**Remember:** ELPS alignment is not optional in Texas—it's a legal requirement and adoption criterion. Every lesson must explicitly support Emergent Bilinguals in developing English proficiency while learning grade-level mathematics. Use MLRs as primary vehicles for ELPS alignment, differentiate by proficiency level, and document alignment clearly for teachers.

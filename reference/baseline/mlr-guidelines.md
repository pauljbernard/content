**Mathematical Language Routines (MLR) overview**

Mathematical Language Routines (MLR) provide opportunities for students
to listen for, and speak, read, and write about mathematical situations.
These routines also provide students the opportunity to develop
understanding of both mathematical language and concepts. The eight MLR
routines are as follows:

+------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| **(MLR1)** Stronger and Clearer    | **(MLR5)** Co-Craft Questions   |
| Each Time                          | and Problems                    |
|                                    |                                 |
| **(MLR2)** Collect and Display     | **(MLR6)** Three Reads          |
|                                    |                                 |
| **(MLR3)** Critique, Correct, and  | **(MLR7)** Compare and Connect  |
| Clarify                            |                                 |
|                                    | **(MLR8)** Discussion Supports  |
| **(MLR4)** Information Gap         |                                 |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

**TE Module Planning Guidelines:**

-   Review module lessons' **Spark Your Learning** and **Tasks** to
    identify MLR usage.

-   List the **MLR title** of the routine under the **Mathematical
    Language Routines (MLRs)** section.

-   After the title, in parentheses, list the lesson(s) where these
    apply. i.e. Lesson X.X, Lesson X.Y), and Lesson (X.Z)

-   Exclude the MLR \# and the term "routine" from each bullet

        dropdown list.]{.mark}

        portion of the Teacher Guide content by finding the row for that
        specific Task and selecting it from the dropdown list.]{.mark}

    -   [If an MLR is not going to be used for either the SYL or
        "**Start** the task\..." portion of the Teacher Guide content,
        select "No MLR" for that SYL or Task row.]{.mark}

-   [Use the [Math Lang Routine: Task (Task Only)]{.underline} column to
    track:]{.mark}

***[Example:]{.underline}***

If for Grade 1, Module 4, Lesson 4, "**Three Reads"** was selected for
the SYL and **"Compare and Connect"** was selected for Task 3 "THEN,
have students\..." portion, the tracker would look like this:

4.  **TE Lesson Level, Imbedded MLR Guidance**

> Pick up imbedded MLRs from reused v1 SYL or Task. For those SYL or
> Tasks that need MLRs, use the following guidance to choose an MLR and
> to determine when, where, and how to incorporate each MLR.

**(MLR1) Stronger and Clearer Each Time**

+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **Purpose:**  | To provide a structured and interactive opportunity  |
|               | for students to revise and refine both their ideas   |
|               | and their verbal and written output (Zwiers, 2014).  |
|               |                                                      |
|               | To have students write their reasoning about a       |
|               | problem, share that reasoning, explain it, listen to |
|               | feedback, respond to feedback, and then refine their |
|               | reasoning by writing again.                          |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **When to     | -   When students can ask questions of each other\'s |
| imbed in the  |     explanations or descriptions so that they can    |
| EMM:**        |     refine their thinking.                           |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **Where to    | **[Tasks]{.underline} (after solving problem):**     |
| possibly      |                                                      |
| imbed in the  | "**THEN,** have students use the **Stronger and      |
| EMM:**        | Clearer Each Time** routine to discuss their         |
|               | thinking.                                            |
|               |                                                      |

|               | \[insert problem related to the task\] and any       |
|               | questions about it. Then in pairs, have students     |
|               | share their thinking. Remind students to ask         |
|               | questions of each other that focus on describing     |
|               | their thinking, especially related to \[insert key   |
|               | mathematical concept(s) or strategy\], and to then   |
|               | use insights from the discussion to refine their     |
|               | answers or reasoning.                                |

**(MLR 2) Collect and Display**

**(MLR 8) Discussion Supports**

+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| **Purpose:**   | To support rich and inclusive discussions about     |
|                | mathematical ideas, representations, contexts, and  |
|                | strategies (Chapin, O'Connor, & Anderson, 2009).    |
+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| **When to      | -   During student discussion of their thinking.    |
| imbed in the   |                                                     |

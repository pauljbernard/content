- South America (Argentina, Colombia, Chile, etc.)

- Vosotros vs. ustedes (Spain uses vosotros for informal plural "you"; Latin America uses ustedes)
- Vos (Argentina, Uruguay, parts of Central America)

**Teaching Approach:**
- Teach one standard variety consistently (often Latin American Spanish)
- Expose students to multiple dialects through authentic materials
- Celebrate linguistic diversity
- Don't present one variety as "correct" and others as "wrong"

- Formal registers
- Grammar explicitly (implicitly acquired at home)
- Honor home variety while teaching prestige standard

**Placement:**
- Assess oral proficiency AND literacy separately

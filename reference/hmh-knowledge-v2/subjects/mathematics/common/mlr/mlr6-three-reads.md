**Mathematical Language Routine #6**
**Source:** Mathematical Language Routines (MLR) Guidelines.docx
**Primary Use:** Spark Your Learning (SYL) and Tasks

---

## Overview

**Three Reads** is the most frequently used Mathematical Language Routine in Into Math TX. It helps students make sense of word problems by reading them three times, each with a different purpose.

**Where Used:**
- **Spark Your Learning (SYL):** REQUIRED in Teacher Edition
- **Tasks:** REQUIRED or alternative MLR in Teacher Edition
- **Review SYL:** Sometimes included

**Purpose:**
- Support students in making sense of mathematical situations
- Develop comprehension of word problems
- Build academic language skills
- Reduce cognitive load by breaking down problem

## The Three Reads Structure

### Read 1: CONTEXT
**Purpose:** What is the situation about?

**Focus:**
- Understand the general context
- Identify the scenario or setting
- NOT focused on numbers or question

**Teacher Prompts:**
- "What is this situation about?"
- "What is happening in this problem?"
- "Describe the context in your own words."

**Student Response:**
- Retell the situation without mentioning specific numbers or the question
- Focus on WHO, WHAT, WHERE

**Example:**
- Problem: "Maria has 12 apples. She gives 5 to her friend. How many does she have left?"
- Read 1 Response: "This is about Maria sharing apples with her friend."

---

### Read 2: QUANTITIES
**Purpose:** What can be counted or measured?

**Focus:**
- Identify all quantities (numbers, measurements, amounts)
- Understand what each quantity represents
- Create a mental inventory of mathematical information

**Teacher Prompts:**
- "What can be counted or measured in this situation?"
- "What are the quantities in the problem?"
- "What mathematical information do we have?"

**Student Response:**
- List all numbers/quantities with what they represent
- Do NOT state the question or attempt to solve

**Example:**
- Problem: "Maria has 12 apples. She gives 5 to her friend. How many does she have left?"
- Read 2 Response: "12 apples that Maria has, 5 apples given to friend."

---

### Read 3: QUESTION
**Purpose:** What mathematical question are we trying to answer?

**Focus:**
- Identify what the problem is asking
- Understand what needs to be found or determined
- Connect question to context and quantities

**Teacher Prompts:**
- "What is the problem asking us to find?"
- "What mathematical question do we need to answer?"
- "What are we trying to figure out?"

**Student Response:**
- State the question in own words
- May begin thinking about solution strategies

**Example:**
- Problem: "Maria has 12 apples. She gives 5 to her friend. How many does she have left?"
- Read 3 Response: "We need to find out how many apples Maria has left after giving some away."

## Implementation in Into Math TX

### Spark Your Learning (SYL) - REQUIRED

**Placement:** Teacher Edition, immediately after START boilerplate

**Format:**
```
START boilerplate...

MLR6: Three Reads
• Read 1 - What is this situation about?
  [Context understanding]

• Read 2 - What can be counted or measured?
  [Quantity identification]

• Read 3 - What mathematical question are we trying to answer?
  [Question clarification]
```

**Example from SYL:**
```
START Use the Building Thinking routine to introduce the task. Have
students read the problem and Think about what the problem is asking.

MLR6: Three Reads
• Read 1: What is this situation about?
  This is about Maria composing shapes to make a house.

• Read 2: What can be counted or measured?
  2 triangles, 1 square

• Read 3: What mathematical question are we trying to answer?
  How can Maria arrange the shapes to make a house?
```

---

### Tasks - REQUIRED or Alternative MLR

**Placement:** Teacher Edition, immediately after START boilerplate

**Format:** Same as SYL, but may be replaced with different MLR if more appropriate for the task

**When to Use Three Reads in Tasks:**
- Problem has word problem context
- Multiple quantities to track
- Complex situation to understand

**When to Use Alternative MLR:**
- Task is primarily visual/spatial (use MLR7: Compare and Connect)
- Task focuses on vocabulary (use MLR2: Collect and Display)
- Task emphasizes explanation (use MLR3: Critique, Correct, and Clarify)

## Boilerplate Text

### Standard Three Reads Boilerplate

Use this exact text in Teacher Edition:

```
MLR6: Three Reads
Before students begin, use the Three Reads routine to support reading
comprehension and sense-making.

• Read 1: [State what the situation is about.]
  Have students describe what the situation is about without using numbers.

• Read 2: [List the quantities.]
  Ask students what can be counted or measured. Emphasize that students
  should NOT state the question or attempt to solve.

• Read 3: [State the mathematical question.]
  Have students describe what mathematical question they are trying to answer.
```

### Abbreviated Version (if space limited)

```
MLR6: Three Reads
• Read 1: What is this situation about? [context]
• Read 2: What can be counted or measured? [quantities]
• Read 3: What mathematical question are we trying to answer? [question]
```

## Linguistic Scaffolding

### Sentence Frames for Emergent Bilinguals

**Read 1 Frames:**
- "This situation is about ___."
- "The problem describes ___."
- "___ is happening in this situation."

**Read 2 Frames:**
- "The quantities are ___."
- "I can count ___ and ___."
- "The numbers in this problem are ___."
- "We have ___ [units]."

**Read 3 Frames:**
- "The question is asking ___."
- "We need to find ___."
- "The problem wants us to ___."

## Common Teacher Errors

### ❌ Rushing Through Reads
**Problem:** Teacher reads problem once, students don't engage
**Solution:** Pause after each read for student responses

### ❌ Allowing Solution Discussion Too Early
**Problem:** Students jump to solving during Read 2
**Solution:** Explicitly remind: "We're not solving yet, just identifying quantities."

### ❌ Teacher Answers Own Questions
**Problem:** Teacher states context/quantities/question instead of eliciting from students
**Solution:** Wait for student responses, even if silence is uncomfortable

### ❌ Skipping Reads for "Simple" Problems
**Problem:** Teacher assumes problem is too easy for Three Reads
**Solution:** Use routine consistently to build habit and support all learners

### ❌ Not Using Student Language
**Problem:** Teacher rephrases student responses in more formal language
**Solution:** Honor student language first, then build toward academic language

## Benefits of Three Reads

### For Students:
1. **Reduces cognitive overload** - Breaks complex problem into manageable parts
2. **Builds comprehension** - Ensures understanding before solving
3. **Supports EBs** - Multiple exposures to text with different purposes
4. **Develops metacognition** - Students learn to analyze problems systematically
5. **Increases confidence** - All students can participate in each read

### For Teachers:
1. **Formative assessment** - Hear what students understand/misunderstand
2. **Identifies misconceptions** - Surface confusion before students attempt solving
3. **Supports differentiation** - All students access the problem at their level
4. **Builds classroom discourse** - Multiple opportunities for student talk
5. **Routine structure** - Predictable pattern reduces planning burden

## Variations and Adaptations

### For Younger Students (K-2):
- Use visuals heavily
- Act out Read 1 (context)
- Point to or circle quantities in Read 2
- Ask question in simpler language for Read 3

### For Complex Problems:
- Add a 4th read: "What strategy might we use?"
- Revisit reads as students work through problem
- Use charts or graphic organizers to track information

### For Visual/Diagram-Heavy Problems:
- Read 1: Describe what you see
- Read 2: What information is shown in the diagram?
- Read 3: What is the diagram helping us figure out?

### For Data/Table Problems:
- Read 1: What is the table/graph about?
- Read 2: What information is in the rows/columns/axes?
- Read 3: What question can we answer using this data?

## Integration with Other MLRs

Three Reads is often combined with other MLRs:

**Three Reads + MLR1 (Stronger and Clearer Each Time):**
- After Read 3, have students explain solution strategy
- Partners give feedback
- Student revises explanation

**Three Reads + MLR2 (Collect and Display):**
- Collect student language from each read
- Display vocabulary wall with context, quantities, questions

**Three Reads + MLR8 (Discussion Supports):**
- Use sentence frames during each read
- Revoice student responses
- Press for details

## Quick Reference Card

**MLR6: Three Reads**

| Read | Focus | Prompt | What to Avoid |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1: Context** | What's happening? | "What is this situation about?" | Don't mention numbers or question |
| **2: Quantities** | What can be counted/measured? | "What quantities do we have?" | Don't solve or state question |
| **3: Question** | What are we finding? | "What mathematical question are we answering?" | Don't give away solution strategy |

**Key Principle:** Each read has ONE purpose. Don't combine or skip.

**Frequency:** Use in EVERY Spark Your Learning and most Tasks.

**Timing:** 2-3 minutes total (less than 1 minute per read once routine is established).

## Sample Implementation Script

**Teacher:** "We're going to use Three Reads to make sense of this problem. I'll read it three times, and each time you'll think about something different."

**[Read problem once, slowly]**

**Teacher:** "Read 1 - What is this situation about? Turn and talk with your partner. Don't use any numbers in your description."

**[Students discuss, teacher circulates, then calls on 2-3 students]**

**Teacher:** "Good! This is about [restate student response]. Now, Read 2 - What can be counted or measured in this problem? Remember, we're NOT solving yet. Just identify the quantities."

**[Read problem again, students respond]**

**Teacher:** "I heard you identify [list quantities]. Excellent. Now for Read 3 - What mathematical question are we trying to answer?"

**[Read problem third time, students respond]**

**Teacher:** "So we need to find [restate question]. Now that we understand the situation, the quantities, and the question, you're ready to solve. Show your thinking!"

---

**Remember:** Three Reads is about building comprehension BEFORE solving. Slow down, honor student language, and let the routine do its work.

# Florida Adoption Criteria and Compliance
**Florida State Requirements for Instructional Materials**
**Source:** Florida Department of Education
**Applies To:** K-12 (Florida only, all subjects)

---

## Overview

**Florida instructional materials** must meet state-specific adoption criteria, align to B.E.S.T. Standards (ELA) and MAFS (Math), comply with content restrictions, and support ESOL students. Florida has one of the most rigorous textbook adoption processes in the nation.

**Core Principle:** Florida prioritizes content accuracy, standards alignment, accessibility, and appropriate content for all students.

---

## Florida vs. Texas vs. California

### Key Differences:

| Aspect | Florida | Texas | California |
|--------|---------|-------|------------|
| **ELA Standards** | B.E.S.T. Standards | TEKS ELA | CCSS ELA |
| **Math Standards** | MAFS (transitioning to B.E.S.T. Math) | TEKS Math | CCSS-M |
| **Language Standards** | ESOL | ELPS | ELD |
| **Content Review** | Comprehensive statute compliance | IPACC (9 categories) | Social content review |
| **Adoption Process** | State-level adoption | State-level adoption | Local adoption |

**Similarity:** All three states require explicit standards alignment, accessibility, and content appropriateness.

## B.E.S.T. Standards (Benchmarks for Excellent Student Thinking)

### ELA Standards Structure

**B.E.S.T. ELA adopted 2020, replacing Florida State Standards (FSS)**

**Format:** `ELA.{Grade}.{Strand}.{Standard}.{Sub-standard}`

**Example:** `ELA.5.R.2.1` = Grade 5, Reading, Standard 2, Sub-standard 1

**Strands:**
- **F:** Foundations (K-2 only)
- **R:** Reading
- **C:** Communication
- **V:** Vocabulary

**Emphasis:**
- Explicit instruction
- Phonics and foundational skills (K-5)
- Informational text emphasis
- Critical thinking and analysis

---

### Math Standards: MAFS → B.E.S.T. Math

**MAFS (Mathematics Florida Standards):**
- Based on Common Core with Florida modifications
- Still in use in many districts (transitioning)

**B.E.S.T. Mathematics:**
- Adopted 2020, full implementation ongoing
- Less emphasis on standards for mathematical practice
- More prescriptive content progressions
- Explicit grade-level expectations

**Format:** `MA.{Grade}.{Domain}.{Standard}.{Sub-standard}`

**Example:** `MA.5.FR.2.1` = Grade 5, Fractions (FR), Standard 2, Sub-standard 1

**Remember:** Florida compliance is rigorous and comprehensive, but most requirements overlap with universal best practices. The architecture allows ~85-90% knowledge reuse from universal and subject-common files, with only state-specific standards alignment (B.E.S.T./MAFS) and ESOL support requiring new Florida-specific files. When you design to Florida standards, you're designing quality materials that will transfer to many other states with minimal adaptation.

# Digital-Print Parity Guidelines for Into Math TX
**Source:** Math Item Specs Guide (updated July 2024)
**Decision:** April 2024 stakeholder agreement (LXD, DDP, PM&S)
**Applies To:** All items in all components

---

## Overview

**Digital-Print Parity** is a foundational principle for Into Math TX. Users (teachers and students) switching between print and digital formats should have nearly identical experiences.

**Core Philosophy:** "Approach the content and interaction choices in a way that meets the needs of the standard it's addressing and maintains the rigor of the problem in both digital & print with parity."

---

## Why Parity Matters

### User Experience Problem:
**Scenario:** Teacher projects digital activity on board. Students follow along in print student edition.

**Without Parity:**
- ❌ Students can't tell if they're on the same item
- ❌ Students don't know where to write their answer
- ❌ Interaction in digital doesn't match print
- ❌ Confusion, frustration, lost instructional time

**With Parity:**
- ✅ Students quickly identify the same item
- ✅ Students know exactly where to write
- ✅ Interactions align across formats
- ✅ Seamless transitions between print and digital

---

### Design Goals (April 2024 Decision):

1. **Reduce wordiness** in digital activities (add whitespace in print instead)
2. **Simplify experience** for classrooms switching between formats
3. **Eliminate errors** from format mismatches
4. **Meet user feedback** requesting better alignment

---

## Defining Parity: The 3-Question Test

For an item to achieve perfect parity, the answer to **ALL THREE** questions must be **YES**:

### Question 1: Recognition
**"Would the student be able to quickly and easily tell that they are on the same item as the teacher?"**

**Tests:** Visual similarity, layout, structure

---

### Question 2: Answer Location
**"Would the student know exactly what/where to write in their student edition if the teacher inputs an answer into the digital item?"**

**Tests:** Answer structure, response format

---

### Question 3: Interaction
**"Would the student understand how to interact with the item in print given the interaction in digital?"**

**Tests:** Task demands, cognitive actions

---

## The 3 Levels of Parity

Parity exists in **3 layers**, each building on the previous:

### Level 1: Parity of Question Structure/Layout
### Level 2: Parity of Answer Structure/Layout
### Level 3: Parity of Interaction

**Goal:** Strive for **ALL 3 levels** of parity in **ALL items** in **ALL components**.

---

## LEVEL 1: Parity of Question Structure/Layout

### Definition:
**Digital and print versions show the same visual structure for the question.**

**Key Principle:** In **ALL cases**, items **CAN and MUST** achieve parity of question structure.

---

### What to Match:

**Visual Elements:**
- [ ] Stem text (identical wording and placement)
- [ ] Images (same size, placement, style)
- [ ] Direction lines (same wording, placement)
- [ ] Question prompt (identical wording)
- [ ] White space (similar visual flow)

**Structural Elements:**
- [ ] Single vs. multi-part structure
- [ ] Paragraph breaks
- [ ] Bullet points or numbering
- [ ] Order of elements

---

### Examples of Parity Violations:

❌ **Violation 1: Different Direction Lines**
- **Print:** Stem and question only
- **Digital:** Stem, question, AND digital-specific direction line

❌ **Violation 2: Multi-Part Mismatch**
- **Print:** Answer and explain on one write-on line
- **Digital:** Part A for answer, Part B for explanation (with extra direction lines)

❌ **Violation 3: Formatting Mismatch**
- **Print:** Stem and direction line as one paragraph
- **Digital:** Stem and direction line separated

---

### Example: BEFORE (No Parity)

**Print:**
```
Draw a model to show 17 ÷ 3. Write the remainder on the line below.

Remainder: _________
```

**Digital:**
```
Part A: Draw a model to show 17 ÷ 3 using the drawing tool.
[Drawing canvas]

Part B: What is the remainder?
[Number input box]

Part C: Interpret the remainder in this context.
[Text response box]
```

**Problem:** These LOOK like different items. Multi-part structure in digital doesn't match print.

---

### Example: AFTER (Parity Achieved)

**Print:**
```
Solve 17 ÷ 3. Show your work in the space below.

[White space for student work]

Remainder: _________
```

**Digital:**
```
Solve 17 ÷ 3. Show your work in the space below.

[Drawing/writing space]

Remainder: [Number input]
```

**Solution:** Same structure, same visual flow. Student can follow along seamlessly.

---

### Acceptable Deviations:

**Columns in Multi-Part Items:**
- Digital may use columns to reduce scrolling
- Print may use linear layout
- **Acceptable** if overall structure is recognizable

---

## LEVEL 2: Parity of Answer Structure/Layout

### Definition:
**The way students interact with the item is the same in both formats.**

**Key Principle:** In **MOST cases**, items can achieve parity of answer structure. A few situations may present challenges.

---

### What to Match:

**Response Format:**
- [ ] Type of response (open-ended, selected, constructed)
- [ ] Number of response areas
- [ ] Labels for response areas (Part A, Part B)
- [ ] Visual layout of response area

**Interaction Type:**
- [ ] Write in blank → Type in blank
- [ ] Circle/box → Select/click
- [ ] Draw model → Use drawing tool
- [ ] Sort into categories → Drag to categories

---

### Examples of Parity Violations:

❌ **Violation 1: Different Answer Types**
- **Print:** Circle and box pictures
- **Digital:** Sort pictures into categories
- **Problem:** Answers won't look the same

❌ **Violation 2: Open vs. Selected Response**
- **Print:** Give answer and explain on write-on line (student generates)
- **Digital:** Fill in blanks on preset explanation (student selects words)
- **Problem:** Different cognitive demand

❌ **Violation 3: Free Response vs. Multiple Choice**
- **Print:** Give answer on write-on line (open-ended)
- **Digital:** Choose from 4 pre-populated answers (selected response)
- **Problem:** Fundamentally different interaction

---

### Example: BEFORE (No Parity)

**Print:**
```
Sort these shapes into two groups. Circle shapes with 4 sides.
Box shapes with 3 sides.

[Images of various shapes]
```

**Digital:**
```
Sort these shapes into categories.

[Drag and drop: Shapes with 4 sides | Shapes with 3 sides]
```

**Problem:** Print asks circling/boxing; digital asks sorting. Different actions.

---

### Example: AFTER (Parity Achieved)

**Print:**
```
Sort these shapes. Draw shapes with 4 sides in the left box.
Draw shapes with 3 sides in the right box.

[Box: 4 sides] [Box: 3 sides]
```

**Digital:**
```
Sort these shapes. Drag shapes with 4 sides to the left box.
Drag shapes with 3 sides to the right box.

[Box: 4 sides] [Drag/Drop area] [Box: 3 sides] [Drag/Drop area]
```

**Solution:** Both ask for sorting into labeled boxes. Action is analogous.

---

## LEVEL 3: Parity of Interaction

### Definition:
**Students interact with the item in the same way (cognitively and physically).**

**Key Principle:** In **MOST cases**, items can achieve parity of interaction. Consider how print and digital can be authored together.

---

### What to Match:

**Cognitive Actions:**
- [ ] Generate answer vs. select answer
- [ ] Create explanation vs. complete explanation
- [ ] Draw freely vs. use tool to draw
- [ ] Sort/categorize vs. match/label

**Task Demands:**
- [ ] Same level of cognitive load
- [ ] Same mathematical processes required
- [ ] Same opportunity for student thinking

---

### Examples of Parity Violations:

❌ **Violation 1: Generate vs. Select**
- **Print:** Student must come up with answer (generate)
- **Digital:** Student chooses from list of pre-populated answers (select)
- **Problem:** Fundamentally different cognitive demand

❌ **Violation 2: Free Draw vs. Constrained Tool**
- **Print:** Draw any model freely
- **Digital:** Limited drawing tools that constrain options
- **Problem:** Digital may artificially limit student thinking

❌ **Violation 3: Direction Line Mismatch**
- **Print:** "Explain your thinking."
- **Digital:** "Select the statement that explains your thinking."
- **Problem:** Different interaction (generate vs. select)

---

### Example: BEFORE (No Parity)

**Print:**
```
What is 48 ÷ 6? Show your strategy.

Answer: _________
```

**Digital:**
```
What is 48 ÷ 6? Choose the correct answer.

○ 6
○ 7
○ 8
○ 9
```

**Problem:** Print requires generation; digital requires selection only.

---

### Example: AFTER (Parity Achieved)

**Print:**
```
What is 48 ÷ 6? Show your strategy in the space below.

[White space for work]

Answer: _________
```

**Digital:**
```
What is 48 ÷ 6? Show your strategy in the space below.

[Drawing/writing space or text entry]

Answer: [Number input]
```

**Solution:** Both require student to generate answer and show thinking.

---

## Rules for All 3 Parity Levels

### Universal Rules:

1. **Strive for ALL 3 levels** of parity in ALL items in ALL components
2. **Question structure parity is non-negotiable** (Level 1 is achievable in 100% of items)
3. **Answer structure and interaction parity are goals** (Levels 2-3 achievable in most cases)
4. **Consult TEKS wording** to determine when specific interaction is required
5. **Don't default to editing only print or only digital** - consider both
6. **Maintain rigor** in both formats

---

### When Parity is Challenging:

**Scenario 1: TEKS Requires Specific Digital Interaction**
- **Example:** TEKS requires "use technology to..."
- **Solution:** Digital has enhanced interaction; print approximates as closely as possible

**Scenario 2: Mathematical Practice Requires Open Response**
- **Example:** Explain mathematical thinking
- **Solution:** Both formats use open response (not multiple choice in digital)

**Scenario 3: Grade-Level Tool Use**
- **Example:** Younger students drawing freely in print
- **Solution:** Digital provides simple, flexible drawing tools

---

## Parity Validation Checklist

### Level 1: Question Structure/Layout
- [ ] Stem text identical in both formats
- [ ] Images same size and placement
- [ ] Direction lines identical (no digital-specific additions)
- [ ] Question prompt identical
- [ ] Visual flow similar
- [ ] Multi-part structure matches (or columns used to reduce scrolling)
- [ ] No extra parts in digital that aren't in print

### Level 2: Answer Structure/Layout
- [ ] Same number of response areas
- [ ] Same type of response (open-ended, selected, constructed)
- [ ] Response areas labeled identically
- [ ] Visual layout of responses similar
- [ ] Interaction type analogous (circle → click, draw → draw)

### Level 3: Interaction
- [ ] Same cognitive demand (generate vs. select)
- [ ] Same task requirements (show work, explain, solve)
- [ ] Same opportunity for student thinking
- [ ] Direction lines match (not "write" in print but "select" in digital)
- [ ] Drawing tools flexible (if drawing required)

---

## Decision Tree: Achieving Parity

### Step 1: Start with Level 1 (Question Structure)
**Question:** Do print and digital LOOK the same?

**If NO:**
- Identify differences (direction lines? multi-part? formatting?)
- Edit print, digital, or both to match
- Ensure stem, images, prompts identical

**If YES:** Proceed to Level 2

---

### Step 2: Check Level 2 (Answer Structure)
**Question:** Do students interact with answers the same way?

**If NO:**
- Identify mismatch (circle vs. sort? write vs. select?)
- Determine which format better meets TEKS
- Edit other format to match

**If YES:** Proceed to Level 3

---

### Step 3: Verify Level 3 (Interaction)
**Question:** Do students do the same cognitive work?

**If NO:**
- Identify cognitive mismatch (generate vs. select? free vs. constrained?)
- Adjust to ensure same rigor and thinking required
- Verify TEKS alignment maintained

**If YES:** Parity achieved! ✅

---

## Common Parity Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Explaining in Print vs. Digital

**Problem:**
- Print: "Explain your thinking." (open-ended)
- Digital: "Select the statement that best explains..." (selected response)

**Solution:**
- **Both formats:** Use open-ended response
- **Digital:** Provide text entry box or audio recording
- **Print:** Provide write-on lines

---

### Challenge 2: Drawing in Print vs. Digital

**Problem:**
- Print: Free drawing with pencil
- Digital: Limited drawing tools

**Solution:**
- **Digital:** Use flexible drawing tools (freehand, shapes, lines)
- **Print:** Provide adequate white space
- **Acceptable deviation:** Digital tool limitations if they don't constrain mathematical thinking

---

### Challenge 3: Multiple Choice in Digital Only

**Problem:**
- Print: Write-on line (open response)
- Digital: Multiple choice (faster to score)

**Solution:**
- **Avoid this pattern** - undermines parity
- **If MC necessary (formative check):** Also use MC in print
- **If rigor requires generation:** Use open response in both

---

### Challenge 4: Multi-Part Items

**Problem:**
- Digital naturally separates into parts (Part A, Part B)
- Print may combine on one page

**Solution:**
- **Match the multi-part structure** in both formats
- **Acceptable:** Columns in digital to reduce scrolling
- **Label consistently:** Both use "Part A," "Part B," etc.

---

### Challenge 5: Drag and Drop in Digital

**Problem:**
- Digital: Drag and drop interaction
- Print: No equivalent

**Solution:**
- **Print:** Ask students to draw, write, or connect
- **Example:**
  - Digital: Drag numbers to number line
  - Print: "Write the numbers on the number line below"

---

## Item Type Parity Guide

### High Parity (Easy to Achieve):

**Math Input:**
- Print: Write-on line for number
- Digital: Number input field
- **Parity:** ✅ Excellent

**Essay (Open Response):**
- Print: Write-on lines for explanation
- Digital: Text entry box
- **Parity:** ✅ Excellent

**Multiple Choice:**
- Print: Circle correct answer
- Digital: Click correct answer
- **Parity:** ✅ Excellent

**Drawing:**
- Print: Draw in space provided
- Digital: Use drawing tools
- **Parity:** ✅ Good (if tools are flexible)

---

### Moderate Parity (Requires Attention):

**Cloze (Fill in the Blank):**
- Print: Write words on blanks
- Digital: Type words OR drag words
- **Parity:** ⚠️ Moderate (drag vs. type is different interaction)
- **Solution:** Prefer typing in digital to match writing in print

**Match List:**
- Print: Draw lines connecting items
- Digital: Drag to match
- **Parity:** ⚠️ Moderate
- **Solution:** Print can say "Draw a line" or "Write the letter"

**Hotspot (Select Regions):**
- Print: Circle or mark regions
- Digital: Click regions
- **Parity:** ⚠️ Moderate
- **Solution:** Ensure print clearly indicates what to mark

---

### Challenging Parity (Requires Careful Design):

**Classification (Sort into Categories):**
- Print: Circle/box different colors, or draw in boxes
- Digital: Drag to categories
- **Parity:** ⚠️ Challenging
- **Solution:** Design print with clear boxes to sort into; digital matches

**Graphing:**
- Print: Plot points on printed graph
- Digital: Use graphing tool
- **Parity:** ⚠️ Challenging (tools vary in flexibility)
- **Solution:** Ensure digital tool doesn't constrain options beyond print

**Order List (Sequence):**
- Print: Write numbers to show order
- Digital: Drag to reorder
- **Parity:** ⚠️ Challenging
- **Solution:** Print asks "Number these 1, 2, 3..." to match sequencing

---

## Parity and TEKS Alignment

**Key Principle:** TEKS wording determines when specific interactions are required.

### TEKS Requiring Generation:
**Examples:**
- "Explain..."
- "Describe..."
- "Represent..."
- "Create..."

**Parity Solution:** Both formats use open response (NOT multiple choice in digital)

---

### TEKS Allowing Selection:
**Examples:**
- "Identify..."
- "Select..."
- "Determine..."

**Parity Solution:** Both formats CAN use selected response (if rigor maintained)

---

### TEKS Requiring Specific Tools:
**Examples:**
- "Use manipulatives to..."
- "Use technology to..."
- "Draw a model..."

**Parity Solution:** Provide equivalent tools in both formats (manipulatives in print, digital tools in digital)

---

## Workflow: Creating Parity from the Start

### Step 1: Author Print and Digital Together
**Don't:** Create digital first, then "convert" to print (or vice versa)
**Do:** Design both simultaneously with parity in mind

### Step 2: Start with Question Structure (Level 1)
- Write stem once, use in both
- Place images identically
- Use same direction lines
- Same multi-part structure

### Step 3: Design Answer Structure (Level 2)
- Choose interaction that works in BOTH formats
- Avoid interactions that only work digitally
- Ensure same number of response areas
- Label consistently

### Step 4: Verify Interaction Parity (Level 3)
- Check cognitive demand is identical
- Ensure rigor maintained
- Confirm TEKS alignment
- Test with "3-Question Test"

### Step 5: Validate
- Side-by-side comparison
- Run through parity checklist
- Get peer review
- Document any deviations and justifications

---

## Tricky Parity Situations

### Situation 1: "Show Your Work" in Digital

**Challenge:** Print has ample white space for work; digital has limited space.

**Solutions:**
- **Option A:** Provide drawing/writing canvas in digital
- **Option B:** Provide scratchwork area separate from answer entry
- **Option C:** Allow upload of photo of work (if supported)

**Best Practice:** Option A (drawing/writing canvas) best maintains parity

---

### Situation 2: Color-Coding in Print

**Challenge:** Print uses colors; digital may have accessibility requirements.

**Solutions:**
- Use patterns in addition to colors (stripes, dots, etc.)
- Ensure alt text describes colors
- Use high-contrast colors that work in grayscale

**Best Practice:** Patterns + colors in both formats

---

### Situation 3: Manipulative Use

**Challenge:** Print references physical manipulatives; digital has virtual versions.

**Solutions:**
- Print shows images of manipulatives (not just referencing them)
- Digital provides virtual manipulative tool
- Both show what manipulative looks like

**Best Practice:** Visual representations in both formats

---

### Situation 4: Audio/Video in Digital Only

**Challenge:** Digital can play audio/video; print cannot.

**Solutions:**
- Provide transcript in both formats
- Provide QR code in print linking to audio/video
- Design problem so audio/video is enhancement, not requirement

**Best Practice:** Core content accessible in both; media is supplement

---

## Non-Parity: When It's Acceptable

### Rare Exceptions:

**1. TEKS Explicitly Requires Digital Tool**
- Example: "Use technology to create a graph"
- Print: Can approximate but will differ

**2. Format-Specific Pedagogy**
- Example: Interactive simulation in digital
- Print: Static images with description

**3. Accessibility Enhancements**
- Example: Screen reader features in digital
- Print: Visual only

**Documentation Required:**
- [ ] Justify why parity cannot be achieved
- [ ] Cite TEKS or accessibility requirement
- [ ] Ensure mathematical rigor maintained in both
- [ ] Document in parity tracking system

---

## Quality Assurance: Parity Review Process

### Self-Review (Author):
1. Complete Parity Validation Checklist
2. Side-by-side comparison of print and digital
3. Run "3-Question Test"
4. Document any deviations

### Peer Review:
1. Second author reviews for parity
2. Checks all 3 levels
3. Flags parity violations
4. Suggests solutions

### Vendor Review:
1. Vendor validates parity compliance
2. Tests interactions in both formats
3. Documents parity level achieved
4. Escalates unresolved issues

### Final Approval:
1. LXD sign-off that parity achieved or justified
2. Documentation of deviations complete
3. Parity tracked in quality system

---

## Parity Metrics and Tracking

### Goal Metrics:
- **100%** of items achieve Level 1 (Question Structure) parity
- **95%** of items achieve Level 2 (Answer Structure) parity
- **90%** of items achieve Level 3 (Interaction) parity

### Tracking:
- [ ] Parity level documented for every item
- [ ] Deviations logged with justification
- [ ] Trends analyzed (which item types struggle with parity?)
- [ ] Continuous improvement based on data

---

## Quick Reference Card

### The 3 Parity Levels:

| Level | Focus | Goal | Achievability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Level 1** | Question Structure/Layout | Print and digital LOOK the same | 100% achievable |
| **Level 2** | Answer Structure/Layout | Students interact with answers the same way | 95% achievable |
| **Level 3** | Interaction | Students do same cognitive work | 90% achievable |

### The 3-Question Test:

1. ✅ Can student tell they're on the same item?
2. ✅ Does student know where to write their answer?
3. ✅ Does student understand how to interact?

**All 3 = YES? → Parity achieved!**

### Rules:
- Strive for ALL 3 levels in ALL items
- Level 1 is non-negotiable (always achievable)
- Consult TEKS for required interactions
- Don't default to editing only one format
- Maintain rigor in both formats

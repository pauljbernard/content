# MLR3: Critique, Correct, and Clarify
**Mathematical Language Routine #3**
**Source:** Mathematical Language Routines (MLR) Guidelines
**Primary Use:** Tasks (with provided student work to analyze)
**Frequency:** Moderate

---

## Overview

**MLR3: Critique, Correct, and Clarify** engages students in **error analysis** by presenting ambiguous or flawed mathematical work for students to critique, correct, and clarify.

**Core Principle:** Analyzing errors deepens understanding by making students articulate what's wrong, why it's wrong, and how to fix it.

---

## Purpose

To have students:
1. **Analyze** presented student work (often flawed or ambiguous)
2. **Identify** errors, ambiguities, or unclear reasoning
3. **Explain** what's wrong and why
4. **Correct** the work or reasoning
5. **Clarify** the correct approach with precise language
6. **Reflect** on their own understanding

**Why It Works:**
- Finding errors requires deep understanding
- Explaining mistakes builds mathematical vocabulary
- Correcting work solidifies correct procedures
- Analyzing others' thinking develops meta-cognition
- Safe way to address misconceptions (work is anonymous)

---

## When to Use MLR3

### Best Situations:
- ✅ When common misconceptions need to be addressed
- ✅ When precision in mathematical language is important
- ✅ When students need practice identifying errors
- ✅ After initial concept introduction (students have some foundation)
- ✅ When building mathematical argumentation skills

### Not Ideal For:
- ❌ Before students understand the concept (need foundation first)
- ❌ Very early in a unit (students lack knowledge to critique)
- ❌ When error is too obvious (not productive struggle)
- ❌ When error requires advanced knowledge students don't have

---

## Where to Embed in Into Math TX

### Tasks (After Concept Introduction):

**Placement:** \"**THEN,** have students use the **Critique, Correct, and Clarify** routine to discuss their thinking.\"

**Position in Lesson Flow:**
1. Students learn concept/procedure
2. Students practice with initial problems
3. **MLR3 HERE** - Present flawed student work to analyze
4. Students identify, correct, and clarify
5. Whole-class discussion of common misconceptions

---

## Two Main Applications

### Application A: Error Analysis
Present work with **errors** for students to find and fix.

**Example:**
"Diego said 3/4 + 2/4 = 5/8. Critique Diego's work, correct his error, and clarify the correct approach."

**Focus:** Identifying mathematical errors

---

### Application B: Clarification of Ambiguous Reasoning
Present work that is **unclear or ambiguous** for students to clarify.

**Example:**
"Maya wrote: 'I got 24 by using the numbers.' Critique Maya's explanation, and write a clearer explanation of how to solve 6 × 4."

**Focus:** Improving mathematical communication

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: PRESENT (Teacher)
**Time:** 1-2 minutes

Present student work to be analyzed:
- Display on board or document camera
- Provide on handout
- Show in digital format

**What to Present:**
- Flawed mathematical work (computation, procedure, reasoning)
- Ambiguous explanation
- Partially correct solution
- Work with missing steps

**Teacher Role:**
- Present without judgment
- Don't indicate if it's right or wrong
- Don't reveal the error location
- Attribute to anonymous student ("A student wrote...")

---

### Step 2: ANALYZE (Individual)
**Time:** 2-3 minutes

Students individually analyze the work:
- Read/examine carefully
- Identify errors or unclear parts
- Consider what's correct (if anything)
- Think about what's wrong and why

**Prompts:**
- "What do you notice about this work?"
- "Is the answer correct?"
- "Is the explanation clear?"
- "Where is the error, if there is one?"

**Teacher Role:**
- Give individual think time
- Don't answer questions yet
- Allow students to work through confusion
- Circulate and observe (don't give hints)

---

### Step 3: CRITIQUE (Partners or Small Groups)
**Time:** 3-5 minutes

Students discuss their analysis with partners:
- Share what they noticed
- Identify errors or ambiguities
- Discuss why it's wrong
- Consider how to explain the problem

**Prompts:**
- "What is mathematically incorrect?"
- "What is unclear or confusing?"
- "What was the student thinking?"
- "What misconception might have caused this error?"

**Teacher Role:**
- Listen to conversations
- Note emerging understanding
- Identify students with clear critiques for sharing
- Don't confirm or deny yet

---

### Step 4: CORRECT (Partners)
**Time:** 2-3 minutes

Students work together to fix the work:
- Make corrections
- Provide accurate work
- Generate correct answer

**Prompts:**
- "How should it be solved correctly?"
- "What steps were missing or wrong?"
- "What's the correct answer?"

**Teacher Role:**
- Ensure students are making corrections
- Look for multiple correction approaches
- Prepare for whole-class share

---

### Step 5: CLARIFY (Whole-Class or Partners)
**Time:** 3-5 minutes

Students explain the correction with precise language:
- Use mathematical vocabulary
- Explain why the correct approach works
- Make reasoning explicit

**Prompts:**
- "How would you explain the correct approach clearly?"
- "What mathematical vocabulary makes your explanation precise?"
- "Why does the correct method work?"

**Teacher Role:**
- Facilitate sharing
- Highlight precise language
- Connect to learning goal
- Revoice or ask students to revoice for clarity

---

### Step 6: REFLECT (Optional)
**Time:** 2 minutes

Students reflect on the error and their learning:
- Why is this error common?
- How can you avoid this mistake?
- What did analyzing this help you understand?

**Teacher Role:**
- Connect to broader mathematical concepts
- Normalize making and learning from mistakes
- Emphasize growth mindset

---

## Standard Implementation Text

### Full Boilerplate:

```
THEN, have students use the Critique, Correct, and Clarify routine to
discuss their thinking.

Present [student name]'s work to the class. Ask students to identify any
errors, explain what is wrong, and clarify how to [insert mathematical
task] correctly. Have students discuss in pairs, then share as a class.
Emphasize using precise mathematical language when clarifying the correct
approach.
```

### Customization Points:

**[student name]:**
Use fictional student name or "A student" for anonymity.

**[insert mathematical task]:**
- "multiply fractions"
- "find the area of the composite figure"
- "solve the equation"

---

## Examples by Grade Band

### K-2 Example (Addition with Regrouping):

**Context:** Students learning 2-digit addition with regrouping.

**Presented Work:**
```
"A student solved 28 + 35:
  28
+ 35
----
  53

The student got 53."
```

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Critique, Correct, and Clarify routine to
discuss their thinking.

Present this student's work to the class. Ask students to identify if
there is an error, explain what happened, and clarify how to add 28 + 35
correctly. Have students discuss in pairs, then share as a class. Guide
students to use place value language when clarifying the correct approach.
```

**Analysis:**
- **Error:** Did not regroup ones; wrote 13 in ones place as "3"
- **Correct Answer:** 63
- **Clarification:** "When ones add to more than 10, we regroup 10 ones as 1 ten."

---

### 3-5 Example (Fraction Comparison):

**Context:** Students comparing fractions.

**Presented Work:**
```
"Diego said: '3/4 is less than 5/8 because 4 is less than 8.'"
```

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Critique, Correct, and Clarify routine to
discuss their thinking.

Present Diego's reasoning to the class. Ask students to critique his
reasoning, identify the error, and clarify the correct way to compare
3/4 and 5/8. Have students discuss in pairs, then share as a class.
Emphasize using precise language about denominators and equivalent
fractions.
```

**Analysis:**
- **Error:** Comparing denominators instead of fraction values
- **Correct Answer:** 3/4 > 5/8
- **Clarification:** "To compare fractions, we need to look at the size of the pieces and how many we have. Using a common denominator of 8: 3/4 = 6/8, and 6/8 > 5/8."

---

### 6-8 Example (Solving Equations):

**Context:** Students solving two-step equations.

**Presented Work:**
```
"A student solved 3x + 7 = 22:
  3x + 7 = 22
  3x = 22 + 7
  3x = 29
  x = 29/3"
```

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Critique, Correct, and Clarify routine to
discuss their thinking.

Present this student's work to the class. Ask students to identify the
error, explain what went wrong, and clarify how to solve 3x + 7 = 22
correctly using inverse operations. Have students discuss in pairs, then
share as a class. Emphasize using precise language about properties of
equality.
```

**Analysis:**
- **Error:** Added 7 instead of subtracting 7 (did not use inverse operation)
- **Correct Answer:** x = 5
- **Clarification:** "To isolate the variable, we use inverse operations. Since 7 is added to 3x, we subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 22 - 7 = 15. Then divide both sides by 3: x = 5."

---

## Types of Errors to Present

### Type 1: Computational Error
**Error:** Mistake in calculation

**Example (Grade 4):**
"35 × 4 = 140" (should be 140, but presented as 120)

**Purpose:** Reinforce procedural accuracy

---

### Type 2: Conceptual Misunderstanding
**Error:** Incorrect mathematical concept applied

**Example (Grade 5):**
"To add 2/5 + 1/3, I added numerators and denominators: 3/8"

**Purpose:** Address misconceptions about fraction operations

---

### Type 3: Incomplete Work
**Error:** Missing critical steps

**Example (Grade 6):**
"I divided 120 by 8 and got 15, so the unit rate is 15."

**Purpose:** Emphasize complete solutions with units and context

---

### Type 4: Ambiguous Explanation
**Error:** Unclear reasoning or vague language

**Example (Grade 7):**
"I got the answer by doing stuff with the numbers."

**Purpose:** Develop precise mathematical communication

---

### Type 5: Misapplied Procedure
**Error:** Using wrong procedure for the situation

**Example (Grade 8):**
"To find slope, I added y-values and divided by sum of x-values."

**Purpose:** Clarify when and how to use specific procedures

---

### Type 6: Notation or Representation Error
**Error:** Incorrect mathematical symbols or representations

**Example (Grade 3):**
Student writes "3/4" to represent 3 groups of 4 objects (should be 3 × 4 = 12)

**Purpose:** Build understanding of mathematical notation

---

---

### Examples of Effective vs. Ineffective Prompts:

**Ineffective (Too Obvious):**
"A student said 2 + 2 = 5."
- Error is so obvious there's no productive analysis

**Effective:**
"A student said when you add two even numbers, you sometimes get an odd number."
- Requires thinking about number properties
- Addresses conceptual understanding

---

**Ineffective (Unrelated to Lesson):**
Present complex algebraic error when lesson is about basic equations
- Students lack knowledge to critique meaningfully

**Effective:**
Present equation-solving error that connects to lesson objective
- Within students' zone of proximal development
- Addresses lesson concept

---

**Ineffective (Too Vague):**
"A student made an error solving this problem."
- Doesn't focus attention
- Too open-ended

**Effective:**
"A student said the area is 20. Identify the error and explain the correct approach."
- Clear task
- Focused analysis

---

## Teacher Facilitation Strategies

### Creating a Safe Environment:

**1. Use Anonymous Work**
- "A student wrote..."
- "Here's some student work..."
- Never use actual student errors publicly without permission

**2. Normalize Errors**
- "Errors help us learn."
- "Mathematicians make mistakes all the time."
- "Finding errors is a valuable skill."

**3. Emphasize Growth**
- Focus on learning from mistakes
- Celebrate clear critiques
- Value precise clarifications

---

### Questioning Strategies:

**Analysis Questions:**
- "What do you notice about this work?"
- "Where might the error be?"
- "Is the reasoning sound?"
- "What was the student probably thinking?"

**Critique Questions:**
- "What is mathematically incorrect here?"
- "Why doesn't this work?"
- "What misconception might have caused this?"
- "How would you explain what's wrong?"

**Correction Questions:**
- "What's the correct answer?"
- "How should this be solved?"
- "What steps were missing?"

**Clarification Questions:**
- "How can you explain this more clearly?"
- "What mathematical vocabulary would make this precise?"
- "Why does the correct method work?"

---

### Common Challenges & Solutions:

**Challenge 1: Students can't find the error**

**Solution:** Provide scaffolding prompts.
- "Look at the first step. Does it make sense?"
- "Check the operation. Is it correct for this problem?"
- "Compare to how we did similar problems."

---

**Challenge 2: Students find error but can't explain WHY it's wrong**

**Solution:** Prompt for reasoning.
- "What rule or concept does this violate?"
- "How do you know that's incorrect?"
- "What should happen instead?"

---

**Challenge 3: Students criticize too harshly**

**Solution:** Model respectful critique.
- Frame as "helping the student understand"
- Use objective language ("The calculation is incorrect" not "They're wrong")
- Emphasize learning, not judgment

---

**Challenge 4: Multiple errors in presented work**

**Solution:** Focus on one key error.
- Simplify the presented work
- Guide students to the most important error
- Save other errors for another time

---

## Integration with Other Supports

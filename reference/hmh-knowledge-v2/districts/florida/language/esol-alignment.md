# ESOL Alignment Guide
**English for Speakers of Other Languages Standards for Florida**
**Source:** Florida Department of Education, WIDA Consortium
**Applies To:** K-12 (Florida only, all subjects)

---

## Overview

**Florida ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages)** standards define instructional requirements for English Language Learners (ELLs). Florida uses the **WIDA English Language Development (ELD) Standards Framework** as the foundation for ESOL instruction.

**Core Principle:** ESOL instruction must be integrated into all content areas (math, science, ELA, social studies) and provided by all teachers, with scaffolds differentiated by English proficiency level.

---

## ESOL vs. ELPS (Texas) vs. ELD (California)

| Aspect | Florida ESOL | Texas ELPS | California ELD |
|--------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| **Framework** | WIDA ELD Standards | ELPS (Texas-specific) | CA ELD Standards |
| **Proficiency Levels** | 6 levels (WIDA 1-6) | 4 levels (Beginning-Advanced High) | 3 levels (Emerging-Expanding-Bridging) |
| **Organization** | 5 language domains | 4 language domains | 3 parts (Collaborative, Interpretive, Productive) |
| **Assessment** | ACCESS for ELLs (WIDA) | TELPAS (Texas) | ELPAC (California) |
| **Instruction Type** | Integrated (all teachers) | Integrated (all teachers) | Integrated + Designated |

**Similarity:** All three require scaffolded support for ELs at multiple proficiency levels integrated with content instruction.

## WIDA ELD Standards Framework

### Five Language Domains:

**1. Social and Instructional Language**
- Language of the classroom
- Social interactions
- Academic routines and norms

**2. Language of Language Arts**
- Literacy development
- Reading comprehension
- Writing skills

**3. Language of Mathematics**
- Mathematical discourse
- Problem-solving language
- Math vocabulary and concepts

**4. Language of Science**
- Scientific inquiry language
- Technical vocabulary
- Observation and explanation

**5. Language of Social Studies**
- Historical and civic language
- Geographic and cultural concepts
- Analysis and argumentation

---

### Four Language Modalities (within each domain):

**1. Listening**
**2. Speaking**
**3. Reading**
**4. Writing**

**Integration:** Each domain x modality combination has specific performance indicators at each proficiency level.

---

## Six WIDA English Language Proficiency Levels

- Limited English proficiency
- Simple sentences, present tense dominant
- High-frequency vocabulary
- Requires substantial support

**Level 3: Developing**
- Intermediate proficiency
- More complex sentences
- Expanding vocabulary
- Requires moderate support

**Level 4: Expanding**
- Advanced intermediate proficiency
- Compound/complex sentences emerging
- Academic vocabulary developing
- Requires light support

**Level 5: Bridging**
- Advanced proficiency

## ESOL in Mathematics

### Language of Mathematics (WIDA Domain 3)

**MLRs Align with ESOL:**
- MLR1 (Stronger and Clearer): Supports oral language development
- MLR2 (Collect and Display): Builds math language
- MLR3-8: All provide language scaffolds
- See: `/subjects/mathematics/common/mlr/`

**Example Scaffolds:**
- Level 1-2: Visual models, sentence frame: "The answer is ___."
- Level 3: Sentence frame: "I solved it by ___."
- Level 4-5: Optional frame: "My strategy was ___ because ___."

- Level 3: "The author shows ___ by ___."
- Level 4-5: "The author's use of ___ reveals ___."

## ESOL Assessment Considerations

### Assessing ELLs Fairly:

**Principles:**
1. **Assess content knowledge, not just English proficiency**
   - Avoid language-heavy assessment for non-ELA content
   - Provide linguistic accommodations

2. **Provide Testing Accommodations:**
   - Extended time
   - Bilingual glossaries
   - Simplified language (for non-ELA tests)
   - Read-aloud (when appropriate)
   - Native language versions (when available)

3. **Use Multiple Assessment Types:**
   - Not just written tests
   - Oral assessments
   - Performance tasks
   - Portfolio evidence

4. **Rubrics Separate Content and Language:**
   - Math: Assess mathematical thinking (not just English explanation)
   - Science: Assess scientific reasoning (language is secondary)
   - ELA: Language IS content, but provide scaffolds

**See Also:** `/universal/assessment/item-writing-best-practices.md`

---

## Florida ESOL Program Models

### Three Models (Districts choose):

**1. ESOL Pull-Out**
- Students leave mainstream class for ESOL instruction
- ESL-certified teacher
- Less common in elementary

**2. ESOL Push-In**
- ESL teacher co-teaches in mainstream classroom
- Collaboration model
- Scaffolds integrated into lessons

**3. Sheltered Instruction**
- Mainstream teacher provides ESOL strategies
- All teachers ESOL-trained (60 hours)
- Most common model

**HMH Materials Support:** Integrated scaffolds support any model (primarily support Model 3: Sheltered Instruction)

---

## WIDA Can Do Descriptors

### Performance Indicators by Level

**WIDA provides "Can Do" descriptors for each level:**

**Example: Speaking (Math, Grade 5)**

**Level 1 (Entering):** Can name numbers, operations using word/phrase with visual support

**Level 2 (Emerging):** Can describe math steps using simple sentences and models

**Level 3 (Developing):** Can explain problem-solving strategies using compound sentences

**Level 4 (Expanding):** Can justify strategies using complex sentences and academic vocabulary

**Level 5 (Bridging):** Can compare strategies and critique reasoning using precise language

**Instructional Design:** Lessons should support students at all levels reaching these indicators

---

## Integration with Content Standards

### Content + Language Integration:

**Every Lesson Should Have:**

**1. Content Objective** (B.E.S.T. or MAFS standard)
Example: "Students will add fractions with unlike denominators"

**2. Language Objective** (WIDA ELD standard)
Example: "Students will explain their strategy orally using sentence frames"

**Both are Essential:** Content and language developed simultaneously

---

## Sentence Frames for ESOL (Cross-Subject)

### Universal Frames (adapt to any subject):

**Level 1-2:**
- "I see ___."
- "This is ___."
- "The answer is ___."

**Level 3:**
- "I think ___ because ___."
- "First, ___. Then, ___."
- "The main idea is ___."

**Level 4-5:**
- "I conclude ___ because ___."
- "The evidence suggests ___."
- "Building on that idea, ___."

- [ ] Vocabulary pre-teaching embedded
- [ ] Multiple means of representation (UDL)
- [ ] Cooperative learning structures

**Differentiation:**
- [ ] Scaffolds differentiated by proficiency level (1-2, 3, 4-5)
- [ ] Not one-size-fits-all supports
- [ ] Progression across levels evident

**Integration:**
- [ ] ESOL strategies embedded in content lessons
- [ ] Content + language objectives stated

**Remember:** Florida's ESOL requirements mean ALL teachers are responsible for supporting English Language Learners, not just ESL specialists. Materials must provide embedded, integrated scaffolds that all teachers can implement. The WIDA framework's 6 proficiency levels require differentiation beyond simple "beginner, intermediate, advanced." When you design with ESOL in mind, you create accessible materials that benefit all learners, not just ELLs.

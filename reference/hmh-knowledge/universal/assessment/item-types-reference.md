### Step 2: Consider Parity
- **Need excellent parity?** → Prioritize: Math input, Essay, Drawing, Shading, Dot Plot, Line Plot, Match List
- **Moderate parity acceptable?** → Cloze types, Label Image types, Classification, Order List, Graphing, Charts
- **Challenging parity (requires careful design)?** → Classification, Order List

---

### Step 3: Consider Grade Level
- **K-2:** Avoid Multiple Response, Choice Matrix, Order List, Essay, Histogram
- **3-5:** All types appropriate except Histogram (typically)
- **6-A1:** All 24 types appropriate

---

### Step 4: Consider Cognitive Demand (DOK)
- **DOK 1 (Recall):** Multiple Choice, Math Input
- **DOK 2 (Skill/Concept):** Most types appropriate
- **DOK 3 (Strategic Thinking):** Essay, Math Essay, Drawing, Graphing, Complex Classification
- **DOK 4 (Extended Thinking):** Essay, Math Essay with extended work

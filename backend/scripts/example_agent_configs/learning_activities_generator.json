Apply instructional routines and strategies from the context above\n2. Incorporate UDL principles (multiple means of representation, action/expression, engagement)\n3. Include scaffolding for emergent bilinguals and struggling learners\n4. Sequence activities from engagement → exploration → explanation → elaboration → evaluation\n5. Estimate time for each activity\n6. Specify grouping (whole class, small group, pairs, individual)\n\n## Format\n\nProvide the activities as a JSON array of objects:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Activity Name\",\n    \"duration_minutes\": 10,\n    \"grouping\": \"whole_class\",\n    \"description\": \"Detailed description of what students and teacher do...\",\n    \"materials\": [\"material 1\", \"material 2\"],\n    \"scaffolds\": [\"scaffold for ELLs\", \"scaffold for struggling learners\"],\n    \"assessment_opportunity\": \"How to formatively assess during this activity\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON array, no additional text.",

# Geographic Reasoning Framework
**Source:** National Geography Standards, C3 Framework
**Applies To:** K-12 Social Studies (all states)

---

## Overview

**Geographic reasoning** helps students analyze spatial patterns, human-environment interactions, and geographic influences on historical and contemporary events.

---

## Five Themes of Geography

**1. Location**
- Absolute location (coordinates, address)
- Relative location (relation to other places)

**2. Place**
- Physical characteristics (landforms, climate, vegetation)
- Human characteristics (culture, language, economics)

**3. Human-Environment Interaction**
- How humans adapt to environment
- How humans modify environment
- Dependence on natural resources

**4. Movement**
- People (migration, immigration)
- Goods (trade, commerce)
- Ideas (communication, cultural diffusion)

**5. Region**
- Formal regions (defined boundaries)
- Functional regions (organized around focal points)
- Perceptual regions (defined by attitudes and feelings)

## Geographic Tools and Representations

**Maps:**
- Political, physical, thematic maps
- Map elements (scale, legend, compass rose)
- Map projections and distortions

**Globes:** Three-dimensional representation

**Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** Digital mapping and spatial analysis

**Data Visualization:** Charts, graphs showing geographic data

## Application Across Grade Levels

**K-2:** Location of self, school, community; basic map skills
**3-5:** Regions, landforms, human geography; intermediate map reading
**6-8:** Global patterns, cultural geography, economic geography; advanced mapping
**9-12:** Geopolitics, spatial analysis, GIS; synthesis and analysis

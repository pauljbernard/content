## Implementation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Intentional Planning

**Before Creating Content:**
- Review CEID checklist
- Plan for diversity in names, contexts, images
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Identify potential bias sources

---

### Strategy 2: Authentic Representation

**Do:**
- Consult diverse voices
- Use authentic names and contexts
- Show diversity naturally (not forced)
- Include diverse creators

**Don't:**
- Tokenize (one diverse example among many non-diverse)
- Stereotype
- Exoticize or "other" groups
- Use diversity only for "diversity lessons"

---

### Strategy 3: Bias Review

**Review Process:**
1. Self-review with CEID checklist
2. Peer review by diverse team member
3. Formal bias review if available
4. Revision based on feedback

---

### Strategy 4: Balance Across Materials

**Track:**
- Name diversity across unit
- Gender representation in examples
- Socioeconomic contexts used
- Geographic variety
- Cultural references

**Goal:** Balance across entire curriculum, not just in isolated examples

---

## Specific Guidance by Content Type

### Names:

**Use Diverse Names:**
- African American: Jamal, Keisha, Tyrone, Alisha
- Hispanic/Latino: Carlos, Maria, José, Sofia
- Asian: Kenji, Mei, Ravi, Priya
- Middle Eastern: Ahmed, Fatima, Zain, Layla
- European descent: James, Emma, Michael, Olivia
- Indigenous: Many tribal nations - consult authentic sources

**Balance:**
- Track names across lessons
- Rotate primary characters
- Avoid always pairing certain names with certain roles

---

### Visual Representation:

**Images Should Show:**
- Racial and ethnic diversity
- Gender diversity in all roles
- People with disabilities included naturally
- Various body types
- Different ages
- Mixed groups (not segregated)

**Avoid:**
- Stock photo "diversity" (artificial looking)
- Stereotypical clothing or settings
- Only showing diversity in "diversity topics"
- Tokenizing

---

### Contexts and Scenarios:

**Inclusive Contexts:**
- Accessible to all socioeconomic levels
- Don't require specific family structures
- Work in urban/suburban/rural settings
- Don't assume resources or experiences
- Culturally relevant to diverse groups

**Examples:**
✅ Community garden, local park, school setting
✅ Free or low-cost activities
✅ Universal experiences

❌ Country club, ski resort, world travel
❌ Expensive hobbies or purchases
❌ Exclusive experiences

---

## Texas IPACC Compliance

### CEID aligns with but extends beyond IPACC:

**IPACC Requires (Texas):**
- No discrimination based on race, sex, etc.
- No superiority of one race/sex
- Balanced perspectives

**CEID Goes Further:**
- Proactive inclusion
- Authentic representation
- Multiple perspectives
- Strengths-based framing

**Note:** Meeting CEID standards helps meet IPACC requirements.

---

## California Standards

**California requires similar CEID attention:**
- Assembly Bill 2016 (diverse textbooks)
- Fair, Accurate, Inclusive, and Respectful (FAIR) Act
- Social content review for bias

**CEID standards align with California requirements**

## Common CEID Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Tokenism

**Problem:** One diverse character among many non-diverse

**Fix:** Consistent diversity throughout all materials

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Stereotyping

**Problem:** "Juan loves tacos" (cultural stereotype)

**Fix:** Authentic, varied representation within groups

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Only Diverse in "Diversity Lessons"

**Problem:** Diversity only appears in lessons about diversity

**Fix:** Diversity is normal in all lessons

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Assumptions About Resources

**Problem:** "On your family vacation to Disney World"

**Fix:** Accessible contexts for all socioeconomic levels

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Single Perspective

**Problem:** Only one cultural viewpoint represented

**Fix:** Multiple perspectives throughout curriculum

**Remember:** CEID is not about checking boxes—it's about creating materials where all students feel valued, represented, and included. Authentic representation requires intentionality, consultation with diverse communities, and ongoing commitment to equity. When students see themselves in curriculum, engagement and achievement increase.

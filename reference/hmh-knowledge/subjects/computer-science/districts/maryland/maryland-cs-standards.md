# Maryland Computer Science Standards
**State CS Standards | Source:** Maryland DOE | **Applies To:** K-12 Computer Science (Maryland)

---

## Overview

**Maryland computer science standards** align to CSTA K-12 CS Standards framework and emphasize computational thinking.

---

## Organization

**Standards:** State-specific CS standards aligned to CSTA framework
**Grade Bands:** K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12 (aligned to CSTA levels)

---

## CSTA Framework Integration

**Maryland CS standards integrate CSTA's five core concepts:**
1. Computing Systems
2. Networks and the Internet
3. Data and Analysis
4. Algorithms and Programming
5. Impacts of Computing

**And seven practices:**
- Fostering inclusive computing culture
- Collaborating around computing
- Recognizing and defining computational problems
- Developing and using abstractions
- Creating computational artifacts
- Testing and refining
- Communicating about computing

**See:** `/subjects/computer-science/common/csta-standards-guide.md` for complete CSTA framework

---

## Knowledge Reuse (85-95%)

**Reused from Common Files:**
- CSTA Standards (`csta-standards-guide.md`)
- Computational Thinking Framework (`computational-thinking-framework.md`)
- CS Pedagogy and Practices (`cs-pedagogy-practices.md`)

**Maryland-Specific (5-15%):**
- State CS standards codes and benchmarks
- State CS course sequences and offerings
- State assessment/certification requirements

---

## Universal Frameworks

**All CS instruction uses:**
- UDL Principles: `/universal/frameworks/udl-principles-guide.md`
- DOK Framework: `/universal/frameworks/dok-framework.md`
- Problem-Solving (from Math): `/subjects/mathematics/common/problem-solving-framework.md`

**Language Support:**
- State EL/MLL standards: `/districts/maryland/language/`
- EB Scaffolding: `/universal/frameworks/eb-scaffolding-guide.md`

**Remember:** Maryland CS standards align to CSTA framework (national standard). Universal pedagogies (computational thinking, CS practices, inclusive culture) apply across all states with 85-95% reuse.

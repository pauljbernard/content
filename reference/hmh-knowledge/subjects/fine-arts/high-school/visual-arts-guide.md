## Art History and Cultural Context

### Major Art Movements (HS Level)

**Western Art:**
- Renaissance (Da Vinci, Michelangelo)
- Baroque (Caravaggio, Rembrandt)
- Impressionism (Monet, Renoir)
- Post-Impressionism (Van Gogh, Cézanne)
- Cubism (Picasso, Braque)
- Surrealism (Dalí, Kahlo)
- Abstract Expressionism (Pollock, Rothko)
- Pop Art (Warhol, Lichtenstein)
- Contemporary Art (Banksy, Koons, Hockney)

**Non-Western Art:**
- African art (masks, textiles, sculpture)
- Asian art (Chinese calligraphy/landscape, Japanese ukiyo-e, Indian miniatures)
- Indigenous art (Native American, Aboriginal, Māori)
- Latin American art (Muralists: Rivera, Orozco, Siqueiros; Frida Kahlo)

**Teaching Approach:**
- Connect to students' artwork ("Today we're learning about Cubism because you're working on perspective")
- Show diverse artists (not just white European men)
- Discuss cultural and historical context
- Make connections to contemporary art

## Sustained Investigation (AP)

**What:** Series of artworks exploring a central idea or question

**Process:**
1. **Inquiry:** Develop a question or theme
   - Example: "How can I use portraiture to express identity?"
2. **Experiment:** Try different materials, processes, approaches
3. **Reflect:** What worked? What didn't? What's next?
4. **Revise:** Refine based on learning
5. **Document:** Photograph process, write about inquiry

**15 Images Required:**
- Show development over time
- Evidence of experimentation and revision
- Written commentary explaining process

---

## Critique Protocol (Advanced)

**Formal Critique:**
1. **Artist Presents:** Explains intent, process, challenges
2. **Class Responds:**
   - Describe (objective observations)
   - Analyze (identify techniques, elements, principles)
   - Interpret (meaning)
   - Evaluate (success based on criteria)
3. **Artist Reflects:** What will I do next?

**Peer Critique:**
- Small groups
- Focus on constructive feedback
- "Glow and Grow" (strengths and areas for improvement)

---

## Portfolio Development

**College/Career Portfolio:**
- 10-20 best works showing range and skill

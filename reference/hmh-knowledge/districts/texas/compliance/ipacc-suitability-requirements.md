# Texas IPACC Suitability Requirements
**Source:** IPACC-Guide_TX-Spec-Writing-Playbook_CURRENT.docx
**Applies To:** All instructional materials for Texas K-12 adoption
**Critical:** Content that violates these requirements will be rejected by Texas SBOE

---

## Overview

**IPACC** (Instructional Products and Content Creation) Suitability Requirements are **mandatory content restrictions** for all Texas educational materials. These requirements come from Texas Education Code and SBOE procurement rules and are **non-negotiable**.

**Key Principle:** When in doubt, escalate to reviewers. Violations can result in material rejection or removal from Texas adoption list.

---

## How to Use These Guidelines

### Application:
- **ALL content** must comply (text, images, activities, assessments, digital resources)
- **ALL grades** K-12
- **ALL content blocks** (SYL, Tasks, Review, Practice, Teacher Edition)
- **External links** must be pre-screened for compliance

### Process:
1. **Review** these requirements before creating any content
2. **Self-check** all content against prohibited categories
3. **Flag** any borderline content for escalation
4. **Document** how controversial content meets educational necessity

---

## 1. General Prohibitions

### No Common Core References
**Rule:** Images and text must NOT reference, imply, or visually align with Common Core State Standards.

**Required:**
- Use **Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)** terminology ONLY
- Reference TEKS standards explicitly
- Use Texas-approved vocabulary

**Prohibited:**
- ❌ "Common Core" mentions
- ❌ CCSS standard codes (e.g., CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.A.1)
- ❌ Common Core-specific vocabulary or frameworks
- ❌ Images showing Common Core materials or references

**Example:**
- ✅ "This lesson addresses TEKS 3.4(A): solve one-step and two-step problems..."
- ❌ "This lesson aligns with CCSS.MATH.3.OA.A.1..."

---

### No Harmful, Obscene, or Vulgar Content
**Rule:** Materials must not contain harmful, obscene, pervasively vulgar, or educationally unsuitable content for minors.

**Prohibited:**
- ❌ Sexual, violent, or prurient imagery
- ❌ Profanity or vulgar language
- ❌ Content that could traumatize students
- ❌ Gratuitous violence or gore

**Allowed:**
- ✅ Age-appropriate historical violence (contextualized)

- ✅ Factual discussion of difficult historical topics (slavery, war)

**Guideline:** Ask: "Would this be appropriate to show in a parent-teacher conference?"

---

### No Sexually Explicit or Relevant Material
**Rule:** Do not include images or text depicting or alluding to sexual conduct, nudity, or reproductive health topics, **except** where required by TEKS and presented age-appropriately.

---

### No Promotion of Abortion
**Rule:** Images and text must not promote or encourage abortion as a pregnancy option.

**For Math Content:**
- This is rarely relevant but avoid controversial medical scenarios in word problems
- If family planning scenarios arise, focus on mathematical operations, not moral positions

---

## 2. Equity and Non-Discrimination

### No Superiority or Discrimination
**Rule:** Content must not suggest that one race or sex is superior, or that individuals are inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive due to their race or sex.

**Prohibited:**
- ❌ Statements that one race/sex is intellectually superior

- ❌ "Boys are better at spatial reasoning problems"

---

### No Attribution of Blame
**Rule:** Do not imply that individuals bear responsibility or guilt for actions committed by others of the same race or sex.

**For Math Content:**
- Avoid word problems that attribute historical injustices to modern individuals
- Focus on mathematical operations, not moral culpability
- Historical problems should be factual, not accusatory

**Example:**
- ✅ "In 1863, enslaved people in Texas gained freedom. Calculate years since then."

---

## 9. Escalation Protocol

### Flagging Issues
**Rule:** If any new or existing image or text content could be construed as leaning toward prohibited areas, **escalate immediately** to designated reviewers.

**When to Escalate:**
- ⚠️ Content touches sensitive historical topics
- ⚠️ Content could be interpreted as political
- ⚠️ Content involves diverse viewpoints on controversial issues
- ⚠️ Content shows violence (even historical/scientific)
- ⚠️ Content could be seen as undermining parental authority
- ⚠️ Unsure if content violates any requirement

**Escalation Process:**
1. Flag content in review
2. Document specific concern
3. Provide context (educational purpose)
4. Wait for reviewer decision before proceeding
5. Document resolution

**Escalation Contacts:**
- HMH LXD Team (internal)
- IPACC SciPi Team
- IP Operations

## 10. Special Content Limits to Enforce

### Brands/Logos
**Rule:** Exclude unless educational purpose requires and cannot be achieved otherwise.

**Default:** No brands or logos
**Exception:** Educational necessity (must justify)
**If Unavoidable:**
- Minimize prominence
- Use multiple brands (avoid endorsement)
- Apply same caution in text

**For Math Content:**
- Use generic products ("juice box" not "Capri Sun")
- Generic packaging in images
- Neutral currency/coins

**Example:**
- ✅ "A student buys 3 juice boxes at $1.25 each"
- ❌ "A student buys 3 Capri Suns at $1.25 each"

---

### Nutrition Visuals
**Rule:** Reinforce nutritious foods and exercise; minimize low-nutrition foods.

**Preferred:**
- ✅ Fruits and vegetables
- ✅ Whole grains
- ✅ Lean proteins
- ✅ Physical activity

**Minimize:**
- ❌ Candy and sweets (except as rare treats)
- ❌ Soda and sugary drinks
- ❌ Fast food
- ❌ Highly processed foods

**Guidelines:**
- Use nutritious foods in most scenarios
- Low-nutrition foods only when essential to problem
- Balance: if using candy for counting, also show fruit counting
- Emphasize healthy choices

**Example:**
- ✅ "Maria has 12 apple slices. She shares 5 with her friend."
- ⚠️ "Maria has 12 candy bars. She eats 5 for breakfast." (sends poor nutrition message)
- ✅ "The store sold 45 apples and 12 candy bars." (neutral transaction)

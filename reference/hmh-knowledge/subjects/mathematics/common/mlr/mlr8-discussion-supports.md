## Where to Embed in Into Math TX

### Tasks (After Solving Problem):

**Placement:** "**THEN,** use the **Discussion Supports** routine to help students discuss their thinking."

**Note:** Slightly different boilerplate (teacher-focused)
- Other MLRs: "have students use the [MLR] routine..."
- MLR8: "use the Discussion Supports routine..." (teacher as facilitator)

**Position in Lesson Flow:**
1. Students work on task
2. Students have thinking to share
3. **MLR8 HERE** - Teacher facilitates discussion with chosen support(s)
4. Students discuss with enhanced participation

## The 7 Discussion Support Strategies

### Choose ONE (or more) support strategies based on student needs:

1. **Revoice** - Model precise language
2. **Press for Details** - Elicit elaboration
3. **Represent Multi-Modally** - Use multiple modes
4. **Practice Vocabulary** - Choral response
5. **Think Aloud** - Model metacognition
6. **Detail Approach** - Describe and justify
7. **Check-In Protocol** - Ensure group participation

---

## Strategy 1: Revoice

### Purpose:
**Model precise mathematical language** by restating student ideas using more formal vocabulary.

### When to Use:
- Student has right idea but imprecise language
- Bridging everyday language to academic language
- Demonstrating how to express mathematical thinking clearly

### Implementation:

**Teacher Action:**
- Listen to student explanation
- Restate using precise mathematical terms
- Ask student to confirm: "Is that what you meant?"

**Example:**

**Student:** "I split the number into parts."

**Teacher (Revoicing):** "So you decomposed the number into tens and ones? Is that right?"

**Student:** "Yeah, decomposed."

**Teacher:** "Great! You decomposed 23 into 20 and 3. Can you say it that way?"

**Student:** "I decomposed 23 into 20 and 3."

### Standard Text:

```
THEN, use the Discussion Supports routine to help students discuss their
thinking.

Revoice student discussion to model precise mathematical language use when
explaining their thinking, strategies, or reasoning of [insert problem
related to the task]. Ask clarifying questions to help students apply
appropriate language.
```

### Example Text:

```
THEN, use the Discussion Supports routine to help students discuss their

sharing 12 cookies among 3 people or showing images of equal groups to
reinforce the concept of division as fair sharing.
```

---

## Strategy 4: Practice Vocabulary

### Purpose:
**Build fluency with mathematical terms** through choral response and repeated practice.

### When to Use:
- New vocabulary introduced
- Terms are challenging to pronounce
- Want whole-class engagement
- Building confidence with academic language

### Implementation:

**Teacher Action:**
- Say term clearly
- Class repeats chorally (all together)
- Individual students repeat
- Use term in sentences together

**Choral Response Protocol:**
1. Teacher: "The word is 'coefficient.' Say it with me."
2. Class: "Coefficient."
3. Teacher: "Again. Coefficient."
4. Class: "Coefficient."
5. Teacher: "Who can use 'coefficient' in a sentence?"

**Example:**

**Teacher:** "This term is 'quotient.' Say it with me: quotient."

**Class:** "Quotient."

**Teacher:** "Great! The quotient is the answer to a division problem. Say that sentence with me: The quotient is the answer to a division problem."

**Class:** [Repeats sentence]

---

### Standard Text:

```
THEN, use the Discussion Supports routine to help students discuss their
thinking.

Practice the use of the terms [insert key mathematical concept(s)] through
choral response.
```

### Example Text:

```
THEN, use the Discussion Supports routine to help students discuss their
thinking.

Practice the use of the terms "numerator" and "denominator" through choral
response. Have students repeat: "The numerator shows how many parts. The
denominator shows how many equal parts in the whole."
```

---

## Strategy 5: Think Aloud

### Purpose:
**Model metacognitive processes** by verbalizing thinking while solving.

### When to Use:
- Students unsure how to approach problem
- Want to model problem-solving process
- Demonstrating strategic thinking
- Showing how to monitor understanding

### Implementation:

**Teacher Action:**
- Solve problem while speaking thoughts aloud
- Narrate decision-making process
- Voice questions and wonderings
- Show self-monitoring ("Wait, that doesn't make sense...")

**Think-Aloud Example:**

**Teacher:** "Let me think aloud about how to solve 3(x + 4) = 24. Hmm, I see parentheses with a variable inside. I could distribute the 3 first... or I could divide both sides by 3 to get rid of the 3 on the outside. Let me try dividing first since it seems simpler. If I divide both sides by 3, I get x + 4 = 8. Now I can subtract 4 from both sides. That gives me x = 4. Let me check: 3(4 + 4) = 3(8) = 24. Yes, that works!"

**Key Features:**
- Narrates choices ("I could... or I could...")
- Explains reasoning ("since it seems simpler")
- Self-monitors ("Let me check...")
- Makes thinking visible

---

### Standard Text:

```
THEN, use the Discussion Supports routine to help students discuss their
thinking.

Have students think aloud about [insert key mathematical concept(s)] while
solving [insert problem related to the task].
```

### Example Text:

```
THEN, use the Discussion Supports routine to help students discuss their
thinking.

Have students think aloud about place value strategies while solving
multi-digit addition problems. Encourage them to verbalize their thinking
as they work: "First I'll add the ones... that's 12, so I'll regroup..."
```

---

## Strategy 6: Detail Approach

### Purpose:
**Elicit detailed descriptions and justifications** using mathematical vocabulary.

### When to Use:
- Students need to articulate full solution process
- Building mathematical communication skills
- Assessing depth of understanding
- Demonstrating use of vocabulary

### Implementation:

**Teacher Action:**
- Ask for step-by-step description
- Request justification for each step
- Prompt for vocabulary use
- Expect complete explanations

**Prompts:**
- "Describe your approach step by step."
- "Why did you do that?"
- "What mathematical term describes what you did?"
- "Justify your thinking."

**Example:**

**Teacher:** "Detail your approach to solving this problem. Use mathematical vocabulary like 'divisor,' 'dividend,' and 'quotient.'"

**Student:** "The dividend is 48, which is the number I'm dividing. The divisor is 6, which is how many groups I'm making. I calculated the quotient by thinking 6 times what equals 48. 6 times 8 equals 48, so the quotient is 8."

---

### Standard Text:

```
THEN, use the Discussion Supports routine to help students discuss their
thinking.

Have students detail their approach to solving [insert problem related to
the task] or describe and justify their thinking to demonstrate use of
mathematical terms such as [insert key mathematical concept(s)].
```

### Example Text:

```
THEN, use the Discussion Supports routine to help students discuss their
thinking.

Have students detail their approach to solving the area problem or describe
and justify their thinking to demonstrate use of mathematical terms such as
"length," "width," "square units," and "area formula."
```

---

## Strategy 7: Check-In Protocol

### Purpose:
**Ensure equitable participation** within groups by having students check in with each other.

### When to Use:
- Group work about to transition to whole-class
- Want to ensure all group members can explain
- Building accountability within groups
- Promoting peer support

### Implementation:

**Teacher Action:**
1. Announce check-in protocol before transitioning
2. Give groups 2-3 minutes to check in
3. Call on variety of students (not just group representatives)

**Check-In Protocol:**
"Within your group, check in with each other to ensure everyone can explain or justify the approach to solving [problem]. I'll call on students from different groups to share."

**Purpose:** Students help each other prepare, knowing any group member might be called on.

**Example:**

**Teacher:** "Before we share out, take 2 minutes in your groups. Make sure everyone can explain how you solved the problem. Check in: 'Can you explain our approach?' Help each other if needed. I'll call on different people from each group."

[2 minutes - groups ensure everyone understands]

**Teacher:** "Okay, let's share. Group 3, I'm calling on... Aisha. Can you explain your group's approach?"

---

### Standard Text:

```
THEN, use the Discussion Supports routine to help students discuss their
thinking.

Provide time for students within groups to check in with one another to
ensure everyone can explain or justify their approach to [insert problem
related to the task]. Then call on a variety of students from each group
to ensure participation.
```

### Example Text:

```
THEN, use the Discussion Supports routine to help students discuss their
thinking.

Provide time for students within groups to check in with one another to
ensure everyone can explain or justify their strategy for finding
equivalent fractions. Then call on a variety of students from each group
to ensure participation.
```

## Examples by Grade Band

### K-2 Example (Composing Shapes):

**Strategy Used:** Multi-Modal Representation + Practice Vocabulary

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, use the Discussion Supports routine to help students discuss their
thinking.

Have students use shape manipulatives to show how they composed the house
shape. Practice the terms "triangle," "square," "compose," and "combine"
through choral response. Invite students to show their house with
manipulatives while explaining: "I combined one triangle and one square to
make a house."
```

---

### 3-5 Example (Multi-Digit Multiplication):

**Strategy Used:** Think Aloud + Revoice

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, use the Discussion Supports routine to help students discuss their
thinking.

Model thinking aloud as you solve 23 × 15 using an area model: "I'll break
23 into 20 and 3, and 15 into 10 and 5. Now I have four partial products
to find..." Then, as students share their strategies, revoice using precise
language: "So you decomposed both factors and found partial products? Is
that right?"
```

---

### 6-8 Example (Solving Equations):

**Strategy Used:** Press for Details + Detail Approach

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, use the Discussion Supports routine to help students discuss their
thinking.

Press students for details in their explanation of solving 2x + 5 = 13.
When a student says "I subtracted 5," ask "Why did you subtract 5? What
property allows you to do that?" Have students detail their complete
approach using terms like "inverse operations," "properties of equality,"
and "isolate the variable."
```

**Solution:** Use during partner/group/whole-class discussion only

### ❌ Mistake 2: Over-correcting student language
**Problem:** Students shut down when constantly corrected
**Solution:** Revoice affirms student idea while modeling precise language

### ❌ Mistake 3: Teacher does all the talking
**Problem:** MLR8 becomes teacher lecture
**Solution:** Use strategies to facilitate STUDENT discussion

### ❌ Mistake 4: Always calling on same students
**Problem:** Check-In Protocol not used, some students never share
**Solution:** Intentionally call on variety of students

### ❌ Mistake 5: Rushing through supports
**Problem:** Strategies feel performative, not meaningful
**Solution:** Give adequate wait time, allow silence for thinking

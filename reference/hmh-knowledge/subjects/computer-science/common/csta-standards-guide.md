## Overview

**CSTA K-12 CS Standards** provide a framework for computer science education organized around five core concepts and seven practices.

---

## Five Core Concepts

**1. Computing Systems:** Hardware, software, troubleshooting
**2. Networks and the Internet:** Cybersecurity, data transmission
**3. Data and Analysis:** Collection, visualization, inference
**4. Algorithms and Programming:** Variables, control, modularity
**5. Impacts of Computing:** Culture, social interactions, safety/security

---

## Seven Practices

**1. Fostering an Inclusive Computing Culture**
**2. Collaborating Around Computing**
**3. Recognizing and Defining Computational Problems**
**4. Developing and Using Abstractions**
**5. Creating Computational Artifacts**
**6. Testing and Refining Computational Artifacts**
**7. Communicating About Computing**

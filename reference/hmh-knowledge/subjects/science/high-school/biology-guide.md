## Overview

Biology is the study of life—from molecules to ecosystems. High school biology introduces fundamental concepts of cell biology, genetics, evolution, and ecology. AP Biology is a college-level course emphasizing inquiry, investigation, and advanced understanding of biological systems.

**College/Career Readiness:** Biology is required for STEM majors (medicine, biology, environmental science, biotechnology) and essential for understanding health, environment, and modern scientific issues.

**State Requirements:** Biology (with lab) is typically required for high school graduation. Some states require Biology EOC exam.

**AP Biology:** College-level course equivalent to two semesters of college biology, emphasizing science practices and lab investigations.

## Core Biology Concepts (Big Ideas)

### 1. Evolution

**Key Concepts:**
- Natural selection (variation, heredity, differential survival/reproduction)
- Evidence for evolution (fossil record, comparative anatomy, molecular biology, biogeography)
- Common ancestry and phylogenetic trees
- Mechanisms: mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, sexual selection
- Speciation and biodiversity

**AP Biology Emphasis:**
- Mathematical modeling of evolution (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium)
- Phylogenetic analysis
- Evidence from multiple disciplines

---

### 2. Cell Structure and Function

**Key Concepts:**
- Cell theory (all living things made of cells, cells from preexisting cells, cells = basic unit of life)
- Prokaryotic vs. eukaryotic cells
- Cell organelles and functions (nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, etc.)
- Cell membrane structure (phospholipid bilayer, proteins)
- Transport (passive: diffusion, osmosis, facilitated; active: pumps, endo/exocytosis)

**AP Biology Emphasis:**
- Membrane transport mechanisms and regulation
- Surface area to volume ratio
- Cell communication (signal transduction pathways)

---

### 3. Cellular Energetics

**Key Concepts:**
- Photosynthesis (light-dependent and light-independent reactions)
- Cellular respiration (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, electron transport chain)
- ATP as energy currency
- Enzymes and activation energy
- Laws of thermodynamics

**AP Biology Emphasis:**
- Detailed pathways and regulation
- Chemiosmosis and ATP synthesis
- Experimental design for investigating photosynthesis/respiration

---

### 4. Genetics and Molecular Biology

**Key Concepts:**
- DNA structure (double helix, nucleotides, base pairing)
- DNA replication
- Protein synthesis (transcription, translation)
- Gene expression and regulation
- Mendelian genetics (dominant, recessive, Punnett squares)
- Non-Mendelian patterns (incomplete dominance, codominance, multiple alleles, polygenic)
- Mutations

**AP Biology Emphasis:**
- Gene regulation (prokaryotic: lac operon; eukaryotic: transcription factors, epigenetics)
- Biotechnology (PCR, gel electrophoresis, CRISPR)
- Viral and bacterial genetics

---

### 5. Cell Division and Development

**Key Concepts:**
- Cell cycle (G1, S, G2, M phases)
- Mitosis (PMAT: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase)
- Meiosis (produces gametes, genetic variation)
- Cancer (uncontrolled cell division)

**AP Biology Emphasis:**
- Cell cycle regulation (checkpoints, cyclins, p53)
- Meiosis and genetic variation (crossing over, independent assortment)
- Developmental biology (gene expression patterns)

---

### 6. Ecology and Ecosystems

**Key Concepts:**
- Levels of organization (organism, population, community, ecosystem, biome, biosphere)
- Energy flow (food chains, food webs, trophic levels, energy pyramids)
- Biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen, water, phosphorus)
- Population dynamics (growth curves, carrying capacity, limiting factors)
- Community interactions (competition, predation, mutualism, parasitism)
- Biodiversity and conservation

**AP Biology Emphasis:**
- Mathematical modeling of populations (exponential vs. logistic growth)
- Community ecology (succession, keystone species)
- Human impact on ecosystems (climate change, habitat loss)

---

### 7. Human Body Systems (Regular Biology, less emphasis in AP)

**Key Systems:**
- Nervous system (neurons, brain, senses)
- Endocrine system (hormones, homeostasis)
- Circulatory system (heart, blood vessels, blood)
- Respiratory system (lungs, gas exchange)
- Digestive system (nutrients, enzymes)
- Immune system (pathogens, antibodies, vaccines)
- Reproductive system

**AP Biology treats body systems as examples of broader concepts (regulation, homeostasis, feedback)**

### 8. Scientific Practices (Critical for AP Biology)

**Science Practices (AP Biology):**
1. Concept Explanation
2. Visual Representations (graphs, models, diagrams)
3. Questions and Methods (experimental design)
4. Data Analysis (statistical tests, error analysis)
5. Argumentation (evidence-based claims)
6. Mathematical Routines (equations, calculations)

**Lab Investigations:**
- 13 AP Biology Investigative Labs (enzyme catalysis, cellular respiration, mitosis, evolution, etc.)
- Inquiry-based, student-designed experiments
- Data collection, analysis, and interpretation

## Quick Reference

**Every HS Biology Material Must:**
- Align to NGSS HS-LS or state standards (TEKS, etc.)
- Emphasize inquiry and investigation (NGSS practices)
- Include hands-on labs (13 AP labs for AP Biology)
- Cover all core concepts (cells, genetics, evolution, ecology)
- Use data analysis and mathematical modeling (especially AP)
- Connect to real-world issues (health, environment, biotechnology)
- Prepare for state EOC exam (if required)
- Support emergent bilinguals (vocabulary, visuals)

**Remember:** Biology is the study of life in all its complexity. From molecules to ecosystems, biology helps students understand themselves, their health, and their environment.

# Science Practices Framework
**Instructional Routines for NGSS Science and Engineering Practices**
**Scope:** Subject-Common (all science programs, all districts using NGSS or similar)
**Audience:** Curriculum developers creating inquiry-based science lessons

---

## Overview

**Science Practices** are the eight NGSS Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs) that describe what students should be able to do to demonstrate understanding of science. This framework provides instructional routines for teaching and assessing each practice.

**Core Principle:** Students learn science by doing what scientists and engineers do—asking questions, investigating, analyzing data, constructing explanations, and communicating findings.

**Equivalent To:** Math MLRs (Mathematical Language Routines) and ELA Literacy Routines—these are the science-specific instructional protocols.

**Scaffolds for EBs:**
- Math-science vocabulary support (density, speed, mass, volume)
- Sentence frames: "The calculation shows ___." "The units are ___."
- Step-by-step calculation guides
- Visual representations (graphs, diagrams)

**Example (Grade 6):**
- **Context:** Comparing densities of materials
- **Math:** Calculate density = mass/volume
- **Application:** Measure mass (grams), volume (mL), divide
- **Interpretation:** "Material A has a density of 2 g/mL. This is higher than water (1 g/mL), so it will sink."

**Integration with Math:**
- Reuse math problem-solving framework
- See: `/subjects/mathematics/common/problem-solving-framework.md`

**Engineering:** Design solutions to problems

### Instructional Routine:

**CER Framework (Claim-Evidence-Reasoning):**

1. **Claim**
   - Answer to the question
   - Statement of what you learned
   - "I claim that ___."

2. **Evidence**
   - Data from investigation or observations
   - Specific facts, measurements
   - "My evidence is ___."

3. **Reasoning**
   - Explanation of how evidence supports claim
   - Connect to scientific principles
   - "This supports my claim because ___."

**Scaffolds for EBs:**
- CER graphic organizer
- Sentence frames for each component
- Model CER responses at multiple levels
- Partner writing before individual

**Example CER (Grade 4):**
- **Question:** Why did the erosion happen faster on the steep slope?
- **Claim:** Water causes more erosion on steep slopes than gentle slopes.
- **Evidence:** In our investigation, the steep slope lost 50g of soil while the gentle slope lost only 10g.
- **Reasoning:** This supports my claim because water flows faster on steep slopes due to gravity. Faster water has more energy to carry away soil particles.

## Practice 7: Engaging in Argument from Evidence

### What Students Do:

**Defend:** Support claims with evidence
**Critique:** Evaluate others' arguments respectfully
**Revise:** Refine ideas based on evidence

### Instructional Routine:

**Scientific Argumentation Protocol:**

1. **Make a Claim**
   - Students take a position on a scientific question
   - Support with evidence

2. **Present Argument**
   - Share claim and evidence with partner/group
   - Use CER structure

3. **Critique Respectfully**
   - Ask questions: "What evidence supports that?"
   - Challenge: "I see it differently because ___."
   - Evaluate: "Is the evidence sufficient?"

4. **Revise Thinking**
   - Modify claim if new evidence warrants
   - Strengthen argument with better evidence
   - Acknowledge when others' arguments are stronger

**Scaffolds for EBs:**
- Sentence frames for agreeing/disagreeing: "I agree because ___." "I respectfully disagree because ___."
- Argument stems: "The evidence shows ___." "However, ___."
- Structured partner or small group discussions
- Think-Pair-Share for lower-stakes practice

**Example (Grade 7):**
- **Question:** Is this organism a plant or animal?
- **Student A Claim:** "It's a plant because it's green and doesn't move."
- **Student B Critique:** "But the evidence shows it captures and digests insects. Plants don't eat other organisms."
- **Revision:** "You're right. It must be a carnivorous plant—a plant that also gets nutrients from insects."

**Integration with ELA:**
- Similar to argument writing in ELA
- See: `/subjects/ela/common/literacy-routines/think-pair-share.md` (discussion protocols)

**Remember:** Science practices are not add-ons—they ARE science. Students learn content by engaging in the practices scientists use. Just as Math MLRs structure mathematical discourse and ELA Literacy Routines structure reading and discussion, Science Practices provide the instructional protocols for inquiry-based learning. The massive knowledge reuse from universal scaffolds (EB support, UDL, assessment) and literacy routines means you're building on proven frameworks, not starting from scratch.

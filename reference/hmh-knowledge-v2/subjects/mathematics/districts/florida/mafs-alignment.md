# MAFS Alignment Guide
**Mathematics Florida Standards for K-8 Mathematics**
**Source:** Florida Department of Education
**Applies To:** K-8 Mathematics (Florida only)

---

## Overview

**MAFS (Mathematics Florida Standards)** are Florida's mathematics content standards, based on Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSS-M) with Florida-specific modifications. Florida is transitioning to **B.E.S.T. Mathematics Benchmarks** (adopted 2020), but many districts still use MAFS.

**Core Principle:** MAFS emphasizes conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, and application—preparing students for college and career readiness.

## MAFS vs. TEKS Math vs. CCSS-M

| Aspect | MAFS (Florida) | TEKS Math (Texas) | CCSS-M (California, etc.) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Origin** | Based on CCSS-M with FL mods | Texas-specific | Common Core |
| **Standard Format** | MAFS.{Grade}.{Domain}.{Cluster}.{Standard} | {Grade}.{Strand}.{Letter} | CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.{Grade}.{Domain}.{Standard} |
| **Example** | MAFS.5.NF.1.1 | 5.3A | CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.A.1 |
| **Practice Standards** | Standards for Mathematical Practice (8) | Process Standards (7) | Standards for Mathematical Practice (8) |
| **Emphasis** | Conceptual + procedural + application | Content + process integration | Conceptual understanding, reasoning |

**Key Similarity:** MAFS and CCSS-M are nearly identical in content (90%+ overlap)

- Texas: `/subjects/mathematics/districts/texas/teks-math-alignment.md`

## MAFS Standard Format

### Structure:

**Format:** `MAFS.{Grade}.{Domain}.{Cluster}.{Standard}`

**Example:** `MAFS.5.NF.1.1`

**Breakdown:**
- `MAFS` = Mathematics Florida Standards
- `5` = Grade 5
- `NF` = Number and Operations—Fractions (domain)
- `1` = Cluster 1 within NF domain
- `1` = Standard 1 within that cluster

**Full Standard Example:**
`MAFS.5.NF.1.1`: Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators (including mixed numbers) by replacing given fractions with equivalent fractions in such a way as to produce an equivalent sum or difference of fractions with like denominators.

---

## MAFS Domains by Grade Band

### K-5 Domains:

**CC:** Counting and Cardinality (K only)
**OA:** Operations and Algebraic Thinking (K-5)
**NBT:** Number and Operations in Base Ten (K-5)
**NF:** Number and Operations—Fractions (3-5)
**MD:** Measurement and Data (K-5)
**G:** Geometry (K-5)

---

### 6-8 Domains:

**RP:** Ratios and Proportional Relationships (6-7)
**NS:** The Number System (6-8)
**EE:** Expressions and Equations (6-8)
**G:** Geometry (6-8)
**SP:** Statistics and Probability (6-8)
**F:** Functions (8)

---

## Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP)

### MAFS includes 8 Standards for Mathematical Practice:

**MAFS.K12.MP.1:** Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them
**MAFS.K12.MP.2:** Reason abstractly and quantitatively
**MAFS.K12.MP.3:** Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others
**MAFS.K12.MP.4:** Model with mathematics
**MAFS.K12.MP.5:** Use appropriate tools strategically
**MAFS.K12.MP.6:** Attend to precision
**MAFS.K12.MP.7:** Look for and make use of structure
**MAFS.K12.MP.8:** Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning

**Note:** Identical to CCSS-M Mathematical Practices

**Integration:** Every lesson should address content standards AND mathematical practices

---

## MAFS vs. B.E.S.T. Mathematics (Transition)

### Florida is Transitioning to B.E.S.T. Mathematics:

**Adopted:** 2020
**Implementation:** Gradual rollout, varies by district
**Full Implementation:** Target 2023-2025 (varies)

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | MAFS | B.E.S.T. Math |
|--------|------|---------------|
| **Origin** | Based on CCSS-M | Florida-developed |
| **Format** | MAFS.{Grade}.{Domain}.{Cluster}.{Std} | MA.{Grade}.{Domain}.{Standard} |
| **Practices** | 8 Math Practices (SMP) | Mathematical Thinking and Reasoning (MTRs) - 7 standards |
| **Content** | Similar to CCSS-M | Modified progressions, more explicit |
| **Example** | MAFS.5.NF.1.1 | MA.5.FR.2.1 |

**For Curriculum Development:**
- Materials created for MAFS can often be adapted to B.E.S.T. Math with standard code updates
- Content overlap is significant (~80%)
- Progressions differ in some areas

**This guide focuses on MAFS** (still widely used). B.E.S.T. Math alignment would be a separate file if needed.

## Integration with MLRs

### Math Language Routines Support MAFS and ESOL:

**MLRs address both:**
- Mathematical Practices (MP.3, MP.6, etc.)
- ESOL language development (WIDA domains)

**Example:**
**MLR3 (Critique, Correct, Clarify)** supports:
- **MP.3:** Construct viable arguments and critique reasoning
- **WIDA Speaking:** Explain and justify reasoning orally
- **ESOL:** Provides sentence frames for academic discourse

**All MLRs align with Florida requirements:**
- See: `/subjects/mathematics/common/mlr/` (8 MLR files)

---

## Vertical Alignment

### MAFS Emphasizes Coherent Progressions:

**Fractions Example (Grades 3-5):**

**Grade 3:** `MAFS.3.NF.1.1` - Understand fractions as parts of a whole
**Grade 4:** `MAFS.4.NF.1.1` - Explain equivalence of fractions
**Grade 5:** `MAFS.5.NF.1.1` - Add/subtract fractions with unlike denominators

**Progression:** Understanding → Equivalence → Operations

**Instructional Design:** Each grade builds on previous, prepares for next

---

## Assessment with MAFS

### Florida Standards Assessments (FSA) - Being Phased Out

**Note:** Florida is transitioning from FSA to B.E.S.T. assessments

**Assessment Principles (remain constant):**
- Align to standards (MAFS or B.E.S.T.)
- Multiple item types (MCQ, multiselect, constructed response, TEI)
- DOK levels match standards
- Accessible to ELLs with accommodations

## Problem-Solving Framework + MAFS

### Framework Supports Mathematical Practices:

**4-Step Framework:**
1. Understand the Problem (MP.1)
2. Make a Plan (MP.1, MP.5)
3. Carry Out the Plan (MP.2, MP.6)
4. Look Back (MP.1, MP.3)

**ESOL Integration:**
- Sentence frames at each step

**Remember:** MAFS alignment is straightforward if you're familiar with CCSS-M—the standards are nearly identical. The key differences are standard code format and Florida's emphasis on ESOL support (WIDA framework). Materials designed for CCSS-M can be adapted to MAFS with minimal effort, primarily updating standard codes and adding Florida-compliant ESOL scaffolds. The architecture's knowledge reuse (~90%) means you're building on a strong universal and subject-common foundation, not starting from scratch.

# RTI/MTSS Framework for Intervention
**Level:** K-12
**Applies To:** All intervention and supplemental programs

---

## Overview

RTI (Response to Intervention) and MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports) provide frameworks for delivering academic and behavioral interventions based on student need.

---

## Three-Tier Model

### Tier 1: Universal (All Students, 80-85%)
- High-quality core instruction
- Differentiation within classroom
- Universal screening (3x per year)
- Applies to all students

**Goal:** Prevent academic/behavioral difficulties

---

### Tier 2: Targeted (Some Students, 10-15%)
- Small group intervention (3-5 students)
- 20-30 minutes, 3-4x per week
- In addition to Tier 1 (not replacement)
- Progress monitoring every 2 weeks
- 8-12 week cycles

**Goal:** Close specific skill gaps

**Example:** Reading intervention group for students below benchmark in phonics

---

### Tier 3: Intensive (Few Students, 5%)
- Individual or very small group (1-3 students)
- 30-60 minutes daily
- May replace some core instruction
- Progress monitoring weekly
- Longer duration (semester/year)
- May lead to special education evaluation

**Goal:** Intensive support for significant needs

---

## Data-Based Decision Making

**Process:**
1. **Screen:** Identify students at risk (universal screeners)
2. **Diagnose:** Determine specific skill deficits
3. **Intervene:** Provide targeted instruction
4. **Monitor:** Track progress frequently
5. **Adjust:** Intensify, continue, or fade support based on data

---

## Intervention Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based

Use interventions with research support:
- Explicit instruction
- Systematic phonics (reading)
- Concrete-Representational-Abstract (math)
- Frequent opportunities to respond
- Immediate corrective feedback

### 2. Matched to Need

Diagnose specific skill gap, target that skill:
- If phonemic awareness deficit → phonemic awareness intervention
- If fluency deficit → repeated reading intervention
- NOT: Generic "struggling reader" group

### 3. Sufficient Intensity

**Intensity = dosage:**
- Group size (smaller = more intensive)
- Frequency (more sessions per week)
- Duration (minutes per session)
- Length of intervention cycle

### 4. Progress Monitoring

Frequent assessment to determine if intervention is working:
- Tier 2: Every 2 weeks
- Tier 3: Weekly
- Use brief, repeatable measures (CBM)
- Graph data, analyze trends
- Make decisions based on data, not time alone

---

## Quick Reference

**Tier 2 Intervention Must:**
- Be in ADDITION to core instruction (not replacement)
- Target specific skill deficit
- Include progress monitoring
- Use evidence-based practices
- Be delivered by trained staff
- Include entry and exit criteria

**Remember:** RTI/MTSS is prevention and early intervention, not just special education identification.

# NYC DOE Curriculum Requirements and Priorities
**District:** New York City Department of Education
**Applies To:** All K-8 instructional materials
**Purpose:** District-specific initiatives beyond NYS standards

---

## Overview

NYC DOE has several **district-wide initiatives** that apply across all subjects and grade levels. Materials must align to New York State standards AND incorporate these NYC-specific priorities.

**Key Initiatives:**
1. Universal Literacy
2. Passport to Social Studies
3. NYC Science Scope & Sequence
4. Algebra for All (Grade 8)
5. Computer Science for All
6. Data-Informed Instruction

---

## 1. Universal Literacy

### NYC's Literacy Initiative (All Subjects)

**Core Principle:** Literacy is not just for ELA class—every subject must develop reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills.

---

### Universal Literacy Components

#### Reading (All Subjects):

**Complex Text Exposure:**
- Grade-level or above texts in all subjects

**Text-Dependent Questions:**
- Questions that require evidence from text
- Cannot be answered without reading the material
- Multiple DOK levels (1-4)

**Annotation Strategies:**
- Mark key information
- Note questions and connections
- Highlight evidence
- Code text (main idea, supporting detail, unknown vocabulary)

**Example in Math:**
Students read a word problem, annotate key information (underline knowns, circle question, box operation clues), then solve.

**Example in Science:**
Students read a passage about photosynthesis, annotate vocabulary, main idea, and evidence, then answer text-dependent questions.

## Quick Reference

**NYC District Priorities:**
1. ✅ Universal Literacy (all subjects)
2. ✅ Passport to Social Studies (C3 + DBQ + NYC focus)
3. ✅ NYC Science (NGSS + hands-on + urban context)
4. ✅ Algebra for All (Grade 8)
5. ✅ CS4All (K-12 CS education)
6. ✅ Data-Informed Instruction (assessment → adjust → teach)

**Material Requirements:**
- Literacy components in all subjects (reading, writing, speaking, listening)
- NYC context and immigration themes (especially Social Studies)
- Hands-on investigations (Science)
- Regents Algebra I alignment (Grade 8 Math)
- Computational thinking integration (all subjects)

---

**Remember:** NYC's district initiatives go beyond state standards. Universal Literacy means every subject develops reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills. Passport to Social Studies emphasizes inquiry, DBQs, and NYC's immigration history. Data-informed instruction requires robust embedded assessments and differentiation resources. Materials must address these district priorities while maintaining full alignment to NYS standards.

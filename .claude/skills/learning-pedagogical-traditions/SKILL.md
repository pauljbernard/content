## Adaptation Strategies

### Matching Pedagogy to Culture

**Confucian Context**:
- ✓ Structured, organized lessons
- ✓ Clear learning sequences
- ✓ Practice and repetition opportunities
- ✓ Group work with defined roles
- ✗ Avoid challenging teacher directly
- ✗ Limit open-ended "no right answer" activities

**Socratic Context**:
- ✓ Open questions for discussion
- ✓ Critical thinking activities
- ✓ Independent projects
- ✓ Student choice and voice
- ✗ Avoid rote memorization emphasis
- ✗ Don't expect deference to authority

**Ubuntu Context**:
- ✓ Collaborative learning
- ✓ Community connections
- ✓ Storytelling and oral traditions
- ✓ Peer teaching
- ✗ Avoid excessive individualism
- ✗ Don't ignore community wisdom

### Hybrid Approaches

**Combining Traditions**:
- Respect foundational philosophy of primary culture
- Layer in complementary methods
- Avoid cultural conflicts
- Be explicit about pedagogical choices

## CLI Interface

```bash
# Adapt to pedagogical tradition
/learning.pedagogical-traditions --content "math-unit/" --tradition "Confucian" --region "China"

# Multiple traditions (e.g., international school)
/learning.pedagogical-traditions --content "course/" --traditions "Socratic,Confucian" --balance "60-40"

# Indigenous pedagogy
/learning.pedagogical-traditions --content "science-unit/" --tradition "Indigenous" --nation "Lakota" --place-based

# Comparison analysis
/learning.pedagogical-traditions --analyze --traditions "Confucian,Socratic,Ubuntu" --topic "mathematics-instruction"
```

## Output

- Culturally-adapted instructional design
- Pedagogical approach recommendations

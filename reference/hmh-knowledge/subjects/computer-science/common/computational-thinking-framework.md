## Overview

**Computational thinking** is a problem-solving approach fundamental to computer science and applicable across disciplines.

## Four Pillars of Computational Thinking

**1. Decomposition**
- Breaking down complex problems into smaller parts
- Identifying sub-problems
- Managing complexity

**2. Pattern Recognition**
- Identifying similarities and patterns
- Finding trends in data
- Generalizing from specific instances

**3. Abstraction**
- Removing unnecessary details
- Focusing on relevant information
- Creating models and simulations

**4. Algorithm Design**
- Creating step-by-step solutions
- Sequencing instructions
- Developing procedures and functions

## Overview

Vocabulary in Into Math TX is systematically tracked and formatted to distinguish between **new** and **review** terms. All vocabulary must be checked against the Vocabulary Tracker before authoring or editing content.

**Key Principle:** Vocabulary treatment (new vs review) is determined by the Vocabulary Tracker, not by judgment.

---

## Formatting Rules - Student Edition

### New Vocabulary
**Format:** Yellow highlight + Bold
**Example:** **<span style="background-color: yellow">remainder</span>**

**When to Apply:**
- Term appears for FIRST time at that grade level (per Vocabulary Tracker)
- Term is labeled "New" in Vocabulary Tracker for this lesson

### Review Vocabulary
**Format:** No formatting (plain text)
**Example:** divide

**When to Apply:**
- Term appeared in earlier lesson at same grade level (per Vocabulary Tracker)
- Term is labeled "Review" in Vocabulary Tracker for this lesson

### Grade K Exception
**Note:** Grade K does not show vocabulary on SE page, so this section does not apply to Grade K.

---

## Vocabulary Tracker Process

### Before Writing/Editing Content:

1. **Reference Vocabulary Tracker**
   - Check if term is already in tracker for this grade
   - Note if term is labeled "New" or "Review"
   - Follow tracker designation

2. **If Term NOT in Tracker:**
   - **DO NOT add yourself** (as of 09/03/2024 update)
   - Reach out to HMH LXD via Issue Tracker
   - Email if needed
   - Request term be added or relabeled

3. **Issues with Tracker:**
   - Report via Issue Tracker: https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/R4g4hGJGjv42HQwjPHjfgg5CQCCRp6F62wRmwF91
   - Email HMH LXD
   - Do not proceed until resolved

### ~~Old Process (No Longer Used):~~

~~If you encountered a term not in tracker, you would:~~
- ~~Add to vocabulary tracker~~
- ~~Fill cell bright yellow if new~~
- ~~Update instance numbers~~

**Current Process:** Contact HMH LXD instead of editing tracker directly.

## Defining Vocabulary in Student Edition

There are **3 approaches** for defining vocabulary terms. Use the approach that was used in V1 for this term.

### Approach A: In a Box
**When Used:** First choice if space allows
**Format:** Standalone box with term and definition
**Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ remainder                       │
│ the number left over when a     │
│ whole number cannot be divided  │
│ evenly                          │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Use When:**
- Room on page for vocabulary box
- Term is central to lesson
- V1 used box format

### Approach B: In Running Text Before a Task
**When Used:** When box causes overset
**Format:** Bold term in sentence with definition following
**Example:**
"When you divide and have some left over, that is called the **remainder**, the number left over when a whole number cannot be divided evenly."

**Use When:**
- Box format would cause overset
- Definition fits naturally in introduction to task
- V1 used running text format

### Approach C: Within a Task
**When Used:** When definition fits naturally in task context
**Format:** Bold term embedded in task with contextual definition
**Example:**
"Find the **quotient**, the answer to a division problem, when you divide 24 by 6."

**Use When:**
- Term emerges organically in task
- Definition makes sense in context
- V1 used within-task format

## Decision Tree for New Vocabulary Terms

**If adding NEW vocabulary term (or content doesn't have V1 source):**

```
START
  ↓
Is there room on page for vocabulary box?
  ↓                                  ↓
YES                                 NO
  ↓                                  ↓
Use Approach A: In a Box    Choose between B and C
                                     ↓
                            Which makes more sense
                            for content flow?
                                     ↓
                            B: Running Text Before Task
                            C: Within Task
```

**Key Principle:** Choose option that makes most sense for content and flow of task.

## Defining Vocabulary in Teacher Edition

### Learning Goals Section
**Requirement:** Clarify 1-2 vocabulary terms
**Format:** Teacher Guide content
**Example:**
"Clarify 'compose' by explaining it means to put together shapes to form a new one."

**Purpose:**
- Help teacher understand key terms
- Provide simple, student-friendly definitions
- Support clear communication with students

### Task Section - Teacher Notes
**Requirement:** Mentioned in Teacher Guide content as needed
**Format:** See EMM Guidelines; Task Section; Teacher Notes Subsection for details

---

## Module Opener: Vocabulary Section

**Purpose:** List all new vocabulary and high-utility words for module

### Content Required:

**Left Column (Boilerplate - Already in Template):**
"Use Words to Learn (WTL) routine in Classcraft or with the module's WTL Vocabulary Cards to help students master any review terms and the following new terms:"

**Right Column (Populate by LXDv):**
- **ALL new vocabulary terms** for module with lesson numbers
- **TWO high-utility words** for module with lesson numbers
- **MLRs** referenced (if applicable)

### Format:
```
- **[vocab term]** (Lesson x.y)
- **[vocab term]** (Lesson x.y)

Consider using the same routines to support students in mastering these
high-utility words:

- **[high-utility term]** (Lesson x.y)
- **[high-utility term]** (Lesson x.y)
```

### If Module Has NO New Vocabulary:
- Enter "N/A" in place of bulleted list
- Update boilerplate: Delete "and the following new terms"
- Revised boilerplate: "Use **Words to Learn (WTL)** in Classcraft or with the module's WTL Vocabulary Cards to help children master any review terms."

## High-Utility Words

### Definition
"Tier 2" words likely to appear in school settings and instruction, but not commonly used in everyday conversation.

**Characteristics:**
- Non-math specific
- Academic language
- Cross-curricular usefulness
- Support comprehension of instruction

### Selection Process

**For Modules with New Lessons:**
1. Look to Learning Goals "I can" statements
2. Look to SE instruction lines
3. Avoid repeating words already used within grade level
4. Use reference list below (NOT exhaustive)

**Documentation:**
- Document in High-Utility Words Tracker (Box link in source)
- Two high-utility words per module

### Examples of High-Utility/Tier 2 Words

| adapt | deduce | infer | rearrange |
| advantages | defend | integrate | reason |
| affects | define | interpret | recall |

## Module Closer: Module Review - Vocabulary Section

**When Included:** When module has **new** vocabulary terms (per Vocabulary Tracker)

**Location:** Before Concepts and Skills section

### Grades 1-A1

**Word Bank Requirements:**
- List **ALL** new vocabulary terms for module
- Text above Word Bank (boilerplate): "Use vocabulary words to complete the sentences."
- Ensure parity with digital pattern
- 2-5 vocabulary items can be authored (due to spacing)
- Items should reflect most critical content

**Special Cases:**
- If only 1 new term: Choose at least 1 review term as distractor for Word Bank
- If 0 new terms: Type "N/A" in Vocabulary Box AND Item # columns
- If line matching format (print): Digital pattern is "Match List" (no Word Bank needed); enter "N/A" in Vocabulary Box

### Grade K

**Format Differences:**
- Vocabulary section may include one problem
- Multiple new terms may be represented within same problem
- Vocabulary represented as IMAGE (students use understanding of word)
- Problems included in TE Data-Driven Instruction table

**If No New Terms:**
- Type "N/A" in Item # and Learnosity Item Type columns

## Pickup Change (Legacy to Current)

**V1 Label:** "Connect to Vocabulary"
**V2 Label:** "Vocabulary"

**Action:** Change "Connect to Vocabulary" to "Vocabulary" for pickup content

## Common Errors

### ❌ Not Checking Vocabulary Tracker
**Problem:** Assuming term is new without checking tracker
**Solution:** Always reference tracker FIRST

### ❌ Inconsistent Formatting
**Problem:** New term not highlighted and bolded
**Solution:** Apply yellow highlight + bold to all new terms

### ❌ Incorrect Approach for Term
**Problem:** Using box format when V1 used running text
**Solution:** Match V1 approach for consistency

### ❌ Adding Term to Tracker Directly
**Problem:** Editing tracker without HMH LXD approval
**Solution:** Use Issue Tracker to request additions

### ❌ Repeating High-Utility Words
**Problem:** Selecting high-utility word already used in grade
**Solution:** Check High-Utility Words Tracker before selecting

### ❌ Using Math-Specific Words as High-Utility
**Problem:** Selecting "quotient" or "parallelogram" as high-utility
**Solution:** High-utility words must be non-math, cross-curricular

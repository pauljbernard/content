# New York Adoption Criteria
**State Education Department Requirements**
**Source:** New York State Education Department (NYSED)
**Applies To:** All New York instructional materials (all subjects)

---

## Overview

**New York uses local control for curriculum adoption** with state oversight through the Board of Regents and NYSED. While there is no formal statewide textbook adoption process, all materials must align to New York State Learning Standards and support Multilingual Learners (MLLs).

**Core Principle:** Materials must align to state learning standards (CCSS-based), support Multilingual Learners, provide accessibility, and demonstrate quality instructional design.

## Key Differences from Other States

| Aspect | New York | California | Texas |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Content Standards** | CCSS-based (NY State Learning Standards) | CCSS-based | TEKS (state-specific) |
| **Language Standards** | CR Part 154 (MLL/ELL) | ELD Standards | ELPS |
| **Adoption Process** | Local district control | State Board adoption | SBOE review + local |
| **Compliance** | NYSED oversight | Content Review Panel | IPACC review |
| **Science Standards** | NGSS-based (NY P-12 Science Standards) | NGSS | TEKS Science |

---

## New York-Specific Requirements

### 1. Content Standards Alignment

**New York State Learning Standards (2017):**
- **Mathematics:** Based on CCSS-M with NY clarifications
- **ELA:** Based on CCSS-ELA with NY modifications
- **Science:** New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards (NGSS-based)
- **Social Studies:** New York State K-12 Social Studies Framework

**Key Context:** New York adopted Common Core, then revised to "New York State Learning Standards" with some modifications.

**Mathematics Standards:**
- Largely identical to CCSS-M
- Some reordering and clarification
- Additional emphasis on fluency and procedural skill

**ELA Standards:**
- Based on CCSS-ELA
- Emphasis on close reading
- Strong focus on argumentation and evidence

**Science Standards:**
- Adopted NGSS framework
- Called "New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards"
- Three-dimensional learning (DCIs, SEPs, CCCs)
- Phenomena-based instruction

---

### 2. Multilingual Learners (Part 154)

**Commissioner's Regulations Part 154:**
- Requires identification, assessment, and services for MLLs (formerly ELLs)
- Programs must provide:
  - Bilingual education (where feasible)
  - English as a New Language (ENL) instruction
  - Content area instruction with appropriate supports

**MLL Proficiency Levels (NYSESLAT):**
- Entering (Beginning)
- Emerging (Low Intermediate)
- Transitioning (Intermediate)
- Expanding (Advanced)
- Commanding (Proficient)

**Similar to California ELD and Texas ELPS but uses different terminology**

---

### 3. Accessibility Requirements

**New York follows:**
- Section 508 compliance
- WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
- Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

**Same as other states in accessibility requirements**

---

### 4. Local Adoption Process

**Unlike Texas and California:**
- New York has **no statewide textbook adoption**
- Each district/school makes own curriculum decisions
- NYSED provides guidance but not formal approval list

**District Evaluation Criteria Typically Include:**
- Alignment to New York State Learning Standards
- Support for Multilingual Learners (Part 154 compliance)
- Assessment quality and alignment to Regents exams
- Digital-print integration
- Cost and usability
- Professional development availability

**Regents Examinations:**
- High school Regents exams drive instructional priorities
- Materials often evaluated on alignment to Regents content/format

---

## What Knowledge Reuses vs. What's New York-Specific

### ✅ Reused from Universal/Common (No NY version needed):

- **DOK Framework** - Same DOK 1-4 levels (universal)
- **MLR (Mathematical Language Routines)** - Same routines (subject-common)
- **Assessment guidelines** - Item types, scoring (universal)
- **UDL Principles** - Same principles (universal)
- **Accessibility** - Alt text, WCAG (universal)
- **CCSS-M Alignment** - 95% same (reuse California CCSS-M with minor notes)
- **NGSS Alignment** - 95% same (reuse NGSS guide with NY branding)

### 🔧 New York-Specific (Requires NY files):

- **Part 154 Compliance** - MLL requirements (different terminology than CA/TX)
- **Local Adoption Guidance** - District-level decision making
- **Regents Exam Alignment** - High school focus (NY-specific assessments)
- **NY Learning Standards Nuances** - Minor differences from pure CCSS

---

## Implementation Notes for Curriculum Developers

### When Creating New York Math Lessons:

**Content Standards:**
- Tag with NY State Learning Standards codes (based on CCSS-M)
- Example: NY-5.NF.A.1 (equivalent to CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.A.1)
- **Practical:** Can use CCSS-M tags with note "Adopted in NY as NY-[code]"

**Language Support:**
- Reference Part 154 MLL requirements
- Use MLRs (same as all states - math common)
- Provide scaffolds for 5 proficiency levels (Entering → Commanding)
- Include ENL (English as a New Language) supports

**Assessment:**
- Same item types as other states (universal)
- Same quality standards (universal)
- For high school: Consider Regents exam formats

**Examples:**
- Can use any mathematical contexts
- May want NY-specific scenarios (NYC subway, Adirondacks, etc.) for local relevance

---

### High School Considerations:

**Regents Examinations:**
- Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II (Regents exams)
- Living Environment, Earth Science, Chemistry, Physics (Regents exams)
- ELA Regents (11th grade)

**Materials should:**
- Align content to Regents scope
- Include practice with Regents-style items
- Address Regents performance indicators

**Not HMH's responsibility but good to know:**
- Districts value Regents alignment
- Regents prep is major factor in high school adoption decisions

---

## Knowledge Resolution Example

**Scenario:** Creating HMH Math NY Lesson 5.3 (Grade 5 Fractions)

**Knowledge Needed:**
1. CCSS-M standards → `/subjects/mathematics/districts/california/ccss-m-alignment.md` (reused!)
   - Note: NY standards nearly identical to CCSS-M
2. MLR6 Three Reads → `/subjects/mathematics/common/mlr/mlr6-three-reads.md` (reused!)
3. DOK Framework → `/universal/frameworks/dok-framework.md` (reused!)
4. MLL Support → `/districts/new-york/language/new-york-mll-standards.md` (NY-specific)
5. Assessment guidelines → `/universal/assessment/` (all reused!)

**Result:** Only 1-2 NY-specific files needed; 95% of knowledge reused!

## New York Education Context

### Geographic Coverage:
- **NYC:** 1.1M students (largest district in US) - 40% of NY enrollment
- **Big 5 cities:** NYC, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Yonkers
- **Suburban districts:** Long Island (Nassau, Suffolk), Westchester
- **Rural districts:** Upstate, North Country, Southern Tier

**Diversity:**
- Highly diverse urban districts (NYC, Buffalo, Rochester)
- Significant MLL populations (150+ languages in NYC)
- Rural districts with different needs

**Implication:** Materials must work in vastly different contexts

---

### State Assessments:

**Grades 3-8:**
- New York State Testing Program (NYSTP)
- Math and ELA annual tests
- Science tests (grades 4, 8)
- Results used for accountability

**High School:**
- Regents Examinations (required for diploma)
- Multiple pathways (Regents diploma, Advanced Regents diploma)

**Materials Consideration:**
- K-8 materials support NYSTP preparation
- High school materials support Regents preparation

**Remember:** New York uses CCSS-based standards with minor modifications, so the vast majority of content guidance can be reused from CCSS/NGSS files. The main NY-specific elements are Part 154 MLL requirements and local district adoption processes. The multi-curriculum architecture makes NY expansion highly efficient with 90-95% knowledge reuse.

# TEKS ELA Alignment Guide
**Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for English Language Arts**
**Source:** Texas Education Agency
**Applies To:** K-8 ELA (Texas only)

---

## Overview

**Texas uses TEKS (Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills)** for ELA content standards, just as it does for mathematics. All Texas ELA instructional materials must explicitly align to TEKS ELA standards.

**Core Principle:** Every lesson and activity must align to specific TEKS ELA standards with clear evidence of alignment.

---

## TEKS ELA vs. CCSS ELA

| Aspect | TEKS ELA (Texas) | CCSS ELA (California, etc.) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **Standard Format** | {Grade}.{Strand}.{Standard} | CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.{Grade}.{Strand}.{Number} |
| **Example** | 5.6C | CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.5.3 |
| **Organization** | By strand and skill | By strand and standard number |
| **Phonics** | Explicit K-3 requirements | Less prescriptive |
| **Skills** | More granular | Broader standards |

---

## TEKS ELA Standard Format

### Structure:

**Format:** `{Grade}.{Strand}.{Standard Letter}`

**Example:** `5.6C`

**Breakdown:**
- `5` = Grade 5
- `6` = Reading Comprehension strand
- `C` = Standard C within strand

---

## TEKS ELA Strands by Grade

## Alignment Documentation

### Required Elements:

**1. TEKS ELA Standard(s)**
```
TEKS: 5.6C
Make inferences and use evidence to support understanding.
```

**2. ELPS Connection** (for EB support)
```
ELPS 4.G: Show comprehension of English text individually and in groups.
```

**3. Evidence of Alignment**
Describe how lesson activities address the standard

---

## Example Alignment (Grade 5 Inference):

**Standard:**
```
5.6C - Make inferences and use evidence to support understanding.
```

**Lesson Alignment:**
- **Read-Aloud:** Students listen to text and make predictions (inference practice)
- **Close Reading:** Students identify evidence in text that supports inferences
- **Discussion:** Students share inferences and cite textual evidence
- **Writing:** Students write inferences with evidence from text

**ELPS Addressed:**
- ELPS 4.G: Show comprehension through discussion and writing
- ELPS 3.E: Share inferences in cooperative learning
- ELPS 5.G: Write explanations of inferences with evidence

**Literacy Routines Used:**
- Close Reading Protocol (finding evidence)
- Think-Pair-Share (discussing inferences)
- Annotation Protocol (marking evidence)

---

## Key TEKS ELA Differences from Math

### Foundational Skills (K-3):
Unlike math, ELA has explicit phonics and foundational skills standards in K-3.

**Example:** `1.1B(iii) - Decode words with consonant blends`

**Implication:** K-3 ELA lessons must address phonics systematically.

---

### Genre Standards:
TEKS ELA specifies genre-specific standards for both literary and informational texts.

**Example:**
- `5.8A` - Infer themes in literary texts
- `5.9A` - Main idea in informational texts

**Implication:** Lessons must specify genre and align appropriately.

---

### Writing Genres:
TEKS ELA specifies four writing genres with separate standards:

**Genres:**
- Narrative
- Informational/Explanatory
- Argumentative
- Correspondence (letters, emails, etc.)

**Example:** `5.12A` - Compose argumentative texts with clear claim and reasons

---

## Knowledge Reuse from Math TX

### What ELA TX Reuses from Texas District:

✅ **IPACC Requirements** - Same content restrictions (Texas district)
✅ **SBOE Quality Rubric** - Same 6 dimensions (Texas district)
✅ **Texas Compliance Checklist** - Same master checklist (Texas district)
✅ **ELPS Alignment** - Same language standards (Texas district)

**Key Point:** All Texas compliance is district-wide (cross-subject), so ELA reuses all of it!

---

### What ELA Reuses from Universal:

✅ **DOK Framework** - Same DOK 1-4 levels (universal)
✅ **UDL Principles** - Same accessibility (universal)
✅ **EB Scaffolding** - Same strategies (universal)
✅ **Assessment Guidelines** - Item types, scoring, parity, validation (universal)
✅ **Alt Text** - Same image accessibility (universal)
✅ **Vendor Checklist** - Same HMH QA process (universal)

---

### What ELA Needs That's ELA-Specific:

🔧 **TEKS ELA Standards** - This file (Texas ELA)
🔧 **Literacy Routines** - Already created (ELA subject-common)
🔧 **Genre-Specific Guidance** - Narrative vs. informational vs. argumentative
🔧 **Phonics Scope and Sequence** - K-3 foundational skills
🔧 **Text Complexity Analysis** - Quantitative and qualitative measures

## Common TEKS ELA Standards by Grade

### Grade 3 (Sample):

## Texas Compliance for ELA

### Same Requirements as Math:

**Because Texas compliance is district-wide (cross-subject), ELA has identical requirements:**

1. **TEKS Alignment** - Must align to TEKS ELA (not CCSS)
2. **ELPS Alignment** - Must support EBs in all 4 domains
3. **IPACC Compliance** - Same 9 content restriction categories
4. **SBOE Quality** - Same 6 quality dimensions
5. **CEID Standards** - Same diversity requirements
6. **Digital-Print Parity** - Same 3 levels of parity
7. **Accessibility** - Same WCAG 2.1 AA requirements

**Benefit of Architecture:** ELA automatically inherits all Texas compliance knowledge without duplication!

**Remember:** TEKS ELA standards differ from TEKS Math in content but follow similar structure. The compliance requirements are identical (all Texas district-wide), allowing massive knowledge reuse. Literacy routines serve the same function as MLRs - consistent, research-based instructional protocols.

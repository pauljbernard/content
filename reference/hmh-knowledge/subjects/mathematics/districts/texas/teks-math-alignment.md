# TEKS Math Alignment Guide
**Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for Mathematics**
**Source:** Texas Education Agency
**Applies To:** K-8 Mathematics (Texas only)

---

## Overview

**Texas uses TEKS (Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills)** for mathematics content standards. All Texas mathematics instructional materials must explicitly align to TEKS Math standards and comply with SBOE Quality Rubric requirements.

**Core Principle:** Every lesson and activity must align to specific TEKS Math standards with clear evidence of alignment, progressive rigor, and support for emergent bilinguals through ELPS.

---

## TEKS vs. CCSS-M

| Aspect | TEKS (Texas) | CCSS-M (California, 41+ states) |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| **Standard Format** | {Grade}.{Process/Content}.{Standard} | CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.{Grade}.{Domain}.{Cluster}.{Standard} |
| **Example** | 5.3A | CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.A.1 |
| **Organization** | Process/Content strands | Domain → Cluster → Standard |
| **Math Practices** | Integrated into standards | 8 separate SMPs |
| **Specificity** | More granular (often more standards per grade) | Broader standards, fewer per grade |
| **Emphasis** | Procedural fluency + conceptual understanding | Conceptual understanding first |

---

## TEKS Math Standard Format

### Structure:

**Format:** `{Grade}.{Strand}.{Standard Letter}`

**Example:** `5.3A`

**Breakdown:**
- `5` = Grade 5
- `3` = Strand 3 (Number and Operations - Fractions)
- `A` = First standard within strand

---

## TEKS Math Strands

### All Grades (K-8):

**Strand 1: Mathematical Process Standards**
- Apply to ALL mathematics activities (like CCSS SMPs but integrated)
- Not assessed separately, but embedded in content instruction

**Process Standards:**
- **1A** - Apply mathematics to everyday experiences
- **1B** - Use problem-solving model
- **1C** - Select tools strategically
- **1D** - Communicate mathematical ideas
- **1E** - Create and use representations
- **1F** - Analyze relationships
- **1G** - Display, explain, and justify thinking

---

### Elementary (K-5) Content Strands:

**Strand 2: Number and Operations**
- Counting (K-2)
- Place value (K-5)
- Comparing and ordering numbers
- Whole number operations

**Strand 3: Number and Operations - Fractions** (Grades 3-5 only)
- Fraction concepts and equivalence
- Operations with fractions

**Strand 4: Number and Operations - Decimals** (Grades 4-5 only)

- Relationship to fractions

**Strand 5: Algebraic Reasoning**
- Patterns and relationships

- Saving, spending, borrowing

---

### Middle School (6-8) Content Strands:

**Strand 2: Number and Operations**

---

## TEKS vs. CCSS-M Key Differences

### 1. Process Standards Integration

**TEKS Approach:**
```
Every TEKS content standard implicitly includes Process Standards (Strand 1).
Teachers address 1A-1G through content instruction.
```

**CCSS-M Approach:**
```
8 Mathematical Practices (SMPs) are separate.
Lessons explicitly connect activities to specific SMPs.
```

**Implication for Texas:** Process standards are embedded, not called out separately. But SBOE rubric expects evidence of mathematical reasoning, communication, and problem-solving in every lesson.

---

### 2. Financial Literacy Strand

**TEKS Unique Requirement:**
Every grade K-8 includes a Personal Financial Literacy strand.

**Examples:**
- **Grade 3:** `3.8C` - Compare advantages/disadvantages of credit/debit cards
- **Grade 5:** `5.10A` - Define income tax, payroll tax, sales tax, property tax
- **Grade 8:** `8.12E` - Calculate and compare simple vs. compound interest

**Implication:** Texas math curricula must include financial literacy content not present in CCSS-M.

---

### 3. More Granular Standards

**TEKS Example (Grade 5 Fractions):**
```
5.3H - Represent/solve addition/subtraction with fractions (denominators ≤ 12)
5.3I - Represent/solve addition/subtraction with mixed numbers (denominators ≤ 12)
5.3J - Represent/solve subtraction requiring decomposing mixed numbers
5.3K - Add/subtract fractions and mixed numbers with like denominators
```

**CCSS-M Example (Grade 5 Fractions):**
```
5.NF.A.1 - Add/subtract fractions with unlike denominators
5.NF.A.2 - Solve word problems with fraction addition/subtraction
```

**Difference:** TEKS breaks into more specific expectations; CCSS-M is broader.

## TEKS Math Adoption Cycles

### Texas Adoption Process:

**State Adoption:** Texas maintains a state-approved instructional materials list.

**Adoption Cycle:** Mathematics materials are reviewed on a regular cycle (typically every 8-10 years, but publishers can submit at any time).

**Current Cycle:** Check TEA website for current proclamation and adoption timeline.

**District Selection:** School districts select from state-adopted list or use local adoption process.

## Key Takeaways

### For Content Developers:

1. **TEKS ≠ CCSS-M:** Don't assume CCSS-M alignment translates to TEKS alignment. Standard codes and some content differ.

2. **Financial Literacy is Required:** Every grade K-8 must include personal financial literacy strand.

3. **Process Standards are Embedded:** Unlike CCSS SMPs, TEKS process standards (1A-1G) are implicit in all content instruction.

4. **SBOE Rubric Matters:** Pay special attention to progressive rigor, spaced retrieval, interleaved practice, fluency labeling, and multiple solution paths.

5. **ELPS Integration Essential:** All lessons must support emergent bilinguals through explicit math language development.

6. **MLRs are Your Friend:** Math Language Routines address both TEKS process standards AND ELPS requirements simultaneously.

7. **Reuse Compliance Knowledge:** Texas district compliance files (IPACC, SBOE, ELPS) apply to all subjects—don't recreate!

---

**Remember:** TEKS Math standards are more granular than CCSS-M, include unique financial literacy content, and embed process standards throughout. All Texas compliance requirements (ELPS, IPACC, SBOE, CEID, parity, accessibility) are district-wide and fully reusable across subjects. Math Language Routines and universal frameworks (DOK, UDL, EB scaffolding) provide consistent, research-based instructional support across all Texas math lessons.

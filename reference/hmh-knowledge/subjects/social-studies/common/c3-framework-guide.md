## Overview

**The C3 Framework** provides a structure for social studies instruction focused on developing students' capacity for informed, civic engagement. It is organized around an Inquiry Arc with four dimensions.

**Core Principle:** Students develop questions, apply disciplinary concepts and tools, evaluate sources, and communicate conclusions to take informed action.

## The Inquiry Arc

### Four Dimensions:

**Dimension 1: Developing Questions and Planning Inquiries**
- Formulate compelling and supporting questions
- Identify disciplinary concepts and ideas
- Develop questions that spark curiosity

**Dimension 2: Applying Disciplinary Concepts and Tools**
- **Civics:** Civic and political institutions, participation, processes
- **Economics:** Economic decision making, exchange and markets, national economy
- **Geography:** Geographic representations, human-environment interaction, movement
- **History:** Change and continuity, perspectives, historical sources

**Dimension 3: Evaluating Sources and Using Evidence**
- Gather and evaluate sources
- Develop claims and use evidence
- Communicate and critique conclusions

**Dimension 4: Communicating Conclusions and Taking Informed Action**
- Communicate conclusions
- Critique conclusions
- Take informed action

## Overview

Chemistry is the study of matter, its properties, composition, structure, and the changes it undergoes. High school chemistry introduces atomic structure, bonding, reactions, stoichiometry, and thermodynamics. AP Chemistry is a college-level course emphasizing quantitative problem-solving, lab investigations, and molecular-level understanding.

**College/Career Readiness:** Chemistry is required for STEM majors (medicine, engineering, pharmacy, chemistry, materials science) and essential for understanding materials, energy, and environmental issues.

**State Requirements:** Chemistry (with lab) is often required or strongly recommended for college-preparatory track.

**AP Chemistry:** College-level course equivalent to two semesters of college general chemistry, emphasizing mathematical modeling and advanced lab techniques.

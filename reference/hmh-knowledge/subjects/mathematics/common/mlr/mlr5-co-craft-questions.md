# MLR5: Co-Craft Questions and Problems
**Mathematical Language Routine #5**
**Source:** Mathematical Language Routines (MLR) Guidelines
**Primary Use:** Introducing new contexts or exploring scenarios
**Frequency:** Low (5-10% of lessons)

---

## Overview

**MLR5: Co-Craft Questions and Problems** invites students to **generate their own mathematical questions** from a given context, scenario, or situation. By creating questions, students engage with the mathematics before solving, building curiosity and ownership.

**Core Principle:** Generating questions develops mathematical reasoning and helps students see mathematics in context.

---

## Purpose

To have students:
1. **Analyze** a context or scenario
2. **Identify** mathematical elements and relationships
3. **Generate** questions that could be asked
4. **Evaluate** which questions are mathematical
5. **Classify** questions by type or difficulty
6. **Select** questions to solve
7. **Reflect** on the question-creation process

**Why It Works:**
- Activates prior knowledge
- Builds curiosity and engagement
- Develops mathematical questioning skills
- Encourages noticing mathematical relationships
- Transfers agency to students (they choose what to explore)
- Reveals student thinking and misconceptions

---

## When to Use MLR5

### Best Situations:
- ✅ Introducing a new unit or concept
- ✅ Rich context or scenario with multiple mathematical possibilities
- ✅ Building problem-posing skills
- ✅ Encouraging curiosity and exploration
- ✅ When students need to identify relevant mathematical information
- ✅ Opening investigation or project-based learning

### Not Ideal For:
- ❌ Simple computational practice (no rich context)
- ❌ When specific question must be answered (not exploratory)
- ❌ Time-limited lessons (needs 15-20 minutes)
- ❌ Very beginning of year (students need some foundation)
- ❌ Every lesson (loses novelty and impact)

---

## Types of MLR5 Applications

### Application A: Open-Ended Scenario
**Setup:** Present rich context; students generate any mathematical questions

**Example (Grade 4):**
Present image of farmers market with prices, quantities, people
Students generate questions like:
- "How much do 5 apples cost?"
- "How many more people bought oranges than bananas?"
- "What's the total cost of 3 apples and 2 oranges?"

**Focus:** Divergent thinking, noticing mathematics in context

---

### Application B: Constrained Question Generation
**Setup:** Present context with specific constraints on question type

**Example (Grade 6):**
Present scenario about distance, rate, and time
Constraint: "Generate questions that require using the formula d = rt"

**Focus:** Targeted practice with specific mathematical concept

---

### Application C: Question Continuum
**Setup:** Generate questions, then arrange by difficulty or complexity

**Example (Grade 7):**
Present scatter plot
Students generate questions, then categorize:
- Easy: "What's the highest value?"
- Medium: "Describe the trend"
- Hard: "Predict the value for x = 15"

**Focus:** Understanding levels of cognitive demand

---

### Application D: Before/During/After Investigation
**Setup:** Generate questions before exploring, revisit during/after

**Example (Grade 5):**
Before: "What questions do you have about this pattern?"
During: "Which questions can we answer now?"
After: "What new questions emerged?"

**Focus:** Sustained inquiry and curiosity

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: PRESENT CONTEXT (Teacher)
**Time:** 2-3 minutes

Present the scenario, context, or situation:
- Show image, video, or real object
- Read scenario aloud
- Display data or information
- Provide manipulatives or models

**What to Present:**
- Rich enough to generate multiple questions
- Accessible to all students
- Relevant to learning goal
- Visually engaging if possible

**Teacher Role:**
- Present without leading questions
- Avoid saying "What do you notice?" yet
- Just present the context clearly

---

### Step 2: INDIVIDUAL NOTICING (Students)
**Time:** 2-3 minutes

Students observe and think individually:
- What do you notice?
- What mathematics do you see?
- What could you calculate or figure out?
- What are you curious about?

**Optional:** Students write notes or jot observations

**Teacher Role:**
- Give quiet think time
- Circulate but don't intervene yet
- Observe what students notice

---

### Step 3: GENERATE QUESTIONS (Individual or Pairs)
**Time:** 5-7 minutes

Students write mathematical questions they could ask about the context.

**Prompts:**
- "What questions could you ask?"
- "What would you like to know?"
- "What could you figure out?"
- "What mathematical questions come to mind?"

**Goal:** Quantity first (generate many questions)

**Teacher Role:**
- Encourage all questions (no wrong questions yet)
- Prompt: "What else could you ask?"
- Remind to make questions mathematical
- Suggest writing 3-5 questions minimum

---

### Step 4: SHARE QUESTIONS (Partners or Small Groups)
**Time:** 3-5 minutes

Students share their questions with partners or small group:
- Read questions aloud
- Listen to others' questions
- Add to their own list (inspired by others)

**Teacher Role:**
- Circulate and listen
- Note interesting or particularly mathematical questions
- Identify questions aligned with lesson goal
- Look for variety (easy, medium, hard)

---

### Step 5: COLLECT QUESTIONS (Whole-Class)
**Time:** 5 minutes

Collect questions from students and display publicly:
- Write on board
- Type and project
- Record on chart paper

**Collecting Strategies:**
- Popcorn style (students call out)
- Gallery walk (pairs write on posters)
- Digital collection (shared doc)

**Teacher Role:**
- Record exactly as students say (don't rephrase yet)
- Encourage diverse questions
- Celebrate creativity
- Aim for 10-20 questions collected

---

### Step 6: CATEGORIZE/ANALYZE QUESTIONS (Whole-Class)
**Time:** 5-7 minutes

Analyze the questions collected:
- Which are mathematical?
- Which can be answered with given information?
- Which require additional information?
- Which are easy, medium, hard?
- Which use operations, measurement, comparison, etc.?

**Possible Sorting Categories:**
- By operation needed (addition, multiplication, etc.)
- By difficulty (DOK 1, 2, 3)
- By information needed (can answer now vs. need more info)
- By topic (measurement, number, geometry)

**Teacher Role:**
- Facilitate categorization
- Ask: "What makes this question mathematical?"
- Highlight connections to learning goal
- Note sophisticated mathematical thinking

---

### Step 7: SELECT AND SOLVE (Whole-Class or Individuals)
**Time:** 10-15 minutes

Select one or more questions to solve:
- Teacher selects (aligned with lesson goal)
- Students vote
- Each student picks one to solve

**Then proceed with solving:**
- Work individually or in pairs
- Share strategies
- Discuss solutions

**Teacher Role:**
- Connect selected question to learning goal
- Facilitate solving process
- Highlight mathematical practices used

---

### Step 8: REFLECT (Optional)
**Time:** 3 minutes

Reflect on question generation:
- "What made a good mathematical question?"
- "What was challenging about creating questions?"
- "How did generating questions help you understand the context?"

---

## Standard Implementation Text

### Full Boilerplate:

```
THEN, have students use the Co-Craft Questions routine to discuss their
thinking.

Present [context/scenario/image] to students without posing a specific
question. Give students 2-3 minutes to observe individually, then ask them
to generate mathematical questions they could ask about the scenario. Have
students share their questions with a partner, then collect questions from
the class. As a class, analyze and categorize the questions (e.g., by
operation, difficulty, or information needed). Select one or more questions
to solve that align with [learning goal]. After solving, reflect on how
generating questions helped students engage with the mathematics.
```

### Customization Points:

**[context/scenario/image]:**
- "an image of a garden with different plants"
- "a data table showing monthly rainfall"
- "a video of a basketball game"

**[learning goal]:**
- "multiplying multi-digit numbers"
- "analyzing data displays"
- "using ratios and rates"

## Examples by Grade Band

### K-2 Example (Counting and Operations):

**Context:** Present image of toy store with different toys and price tags.

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Co-Craft Questions routine to discuss their
thinking.

Present an image of a toy store with toys labeled with prices. Give students
2-3 minutes to observe individually, then ask them to think of questions they
could ask about the toys and prices. Have students share their questions with
a partner. Collect questions from the class and record them on chart paper.
Help students categorize questions (e.g., counting questions, comparing
questions, addition questions). Select 2-3 questions to solve together that
involve addition or subtraction of prices. After solving, reflect on what
kinds of questions we can ask when we see prices.
```

**Sample Student Questions:**
- "How many toys are there?"
- "Which toy costs the most?"
- "How much do a ball and a doll cost together?"
- "How many more trucks are there than cars?"

**Learning Goal Connection:** Addition and subtraction in context

---

### 3-5 Example (Multiplication and Area):

**Context:** Present diagram of playground with different sections (swings area, basketball court, garden) with dimensions.

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Co-Craft Questions routine to discuss their
thinking.

Present a diagram of a playground showing different rectangular sections with
labeled dimensions. Give students 3-4 minutes to observe and generate
mathematical questions individually. Have students share their questions with
a partner, then collect questions from the class. Categorize questions by
operation or concept (e.g., area, perimeter, comparison). Select questions
that involve finding areas of rectangles to solve as a class. After solving,
discuss how generating questions helped students identify what could be
calculated from dimensions.
```

**Sample Student Questions:**
- "What's the area of the basketball court?"
- "Which section has the biggest area?"
- "What's the perimeter of the whole playground?"
- "How much bigger is the basketball court than the garden?"
- "What's the total area of all sections combined?"

**Learning Goal Connection:** Area and perimeter of rectangles

---

### 6-8 Example (Proportional Relationships):

**Context:** Present a recipe that serves 4 people with ingredient amounts listed.

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Co-Craft Questions routine to discuss their
thinking.

Present a recipe that serves 4 people, showing ingredient amounts. Give
students 3-4 minutes to observe and generate questions about the recipe that
involve ratios or proportional relationships. Have students share questions
with a partner, then collect them as a class. Analyze which questions
require proportional reasoning and which involve other operations. Select
questions that require scaling the recipe up or down to solve. After solving,
reflect on how ratios and rates appear in real-world contexts like recipes.
```

**Sample Student Questions:**
- "How much of each ingredient for 8 people?"
- "What if I want to make it for 6 people?"
- "What's the ratio of flour to sugar?"
- "How many batches to serve 24 people?"
- "If I double the flour, what happens to other ingredients?"

**Learning Goal Connection:** Proportional reasoning and scaling

## Question Quality: What Makes a Good Mathematical Question?

### Characteristics of Strong Mathematical Questions:

**1. Calculable/Answerable**
- Question can be answered using mathematics
- Information needed is available (or students identify what's missing)

**2. Specific**
- Clear what's being asked
- Not too vague ("What about the numbers?")

**3. Aligned with Context**
- Makes sense given the scenario
- Uses information provided

**4. Invites Mathematical Thinking**
- Requires mathematical operation, reasoning, or analysis
- Not just observation ("I see 3 apples")

**5. Appropriately Challenging**
- Within reach of students' abilities
- Extends thinking beyond obvious

---

### Examples of Question Quality:

**Weak Questions:**
- ❌ "What are the numbers?" (vague)
- ❌ "I see apples." (observation, not question)
- ❌ "What's your favorite color?" (not mathematical)

**Strong Questions:**
- ✅ "How many apples are there in total?"
- ✅ "What's the difference between the number of red and green apples?"
- ✅ "If apples cost $2 each, how much for 5 apples?"

---

## Teacher Facilitation Strategies

### Encouraging Diverse Questions:

**Prompts:**
- "What could you count or measure?"
- "What could you compare?"
- "What could you calculate?"
- "What patterns do you notice that raise questions?"
- "What are you curious about?"

---

### Responding to Non-Mathematical Questions:

**If student asks:** "What color are the apples?"

**Teacher response:**
- "That's an observational question. Can you make it mathematical?"
- "How could you turn that into a question we could calculate or figure out?"
- "What could you count, measure, or compare about the colors?"

**Turn it mathematical:**
- "How many red apples compared to green apples?"

---

### Handling Too Many Questions:

**Strategy 1: Prioritize**
- "Which questions align with what we're learning?"
- "Let's solve these two today and save others for later."

**Strategy 2: Parking Lot**
- Record all questions
- Mark which to solve now
- Save others for extension or future lessons

**Strategy 3: Student Choice**
- Each student selects one question from the list to solve independently

---

### Connecting to Learning Goals:

**During Categorization:**
- "Which questions involve [target concept]?"
- "I notice several questions about area. That's what we're learning this week."
- "This question requires [skill]. Let's solve this one together."

**After Solving:**
- "How did generating questions help you see [concept] in this context?"
- "What other situations might lead to similar questions?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Context is too simple
**Problem:** Only one obvious question can be asked
**Solution:** Use rich, complex contexts with multiple entry points

### ❌ Mistake 2: Skipping the solving step
**Problem:** Generate questions but never solve any
**Solution:** Always solve at least one question generated by students

### ❌ Mistake 3: Teacher poses the "real" question immediately
**Problem:** "What questions could you ask? [Students respond] Okay, but we're going to solve MY question instead."
**Solution:** Honor student questions by solving at least one

### ❌ Mistake 4: Accepting non-mathematical questions
**Problem:** "What color is the car?" accepted without pushing for mathematical framing
**Solution:** Redirect: "Can you make that mathematical? What could you count or measure about the colors?"

### ❌ Mistake 5: Using every lesson
**Problem:** Loses novelty and takes too much time
**Solution:** Use strategically (5-10% of lessons), especially for new units or rich contexts

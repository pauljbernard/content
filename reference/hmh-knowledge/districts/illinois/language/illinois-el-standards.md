# Illinois English Learner Standards
**WIDA English Language Development Standards**
**Source:** WIDA Consortium / Illinois State Board of Education
**Applies To:** K-12 (Illinois and 40+ WIDA states)

---

## Overview

**Illinois is a member of the WIDA (World-Class Instructional Design and Assessment) consortium.** All instructional materials must provide scaffolds for English Learners (ELs) using WIDA English Language Development (ELD) Standards.

**Core Principle:** ELs must access grade-level content while developing English proficiency. Scaffolds support access without reducing academic rigor.

## WIDA English Language Development Standards

### Five ELD Standards:

**Standard 1:** Social and Instructional Language
- Interact with peers and teachers in social and academic settings

**Standard 2:** The Language of Language Arts
- Process and produce language of reading, writing, speaking, listening

**Standard 3:** The Language of Mathematics
- Process and produce mathematical language and representations

**Standard 4:** The Language of Science
- Process and produce scientific language and investigations

**Standard 5:** The Language of Social Studies
- Process and produce social studies language and civic discourse

**HMH Materials:** Address Standards 2 (ELA), 3 (Math), and 4 (Science) depending on subject

## WIDA Proficiency Levels

### Six Levels (1.0 - 6.0):

**Level 1: Entering**
- Minimal or no English proficiency
- Single words, short phrases
- Heavy reliance on native language and visuals

**Level 2: Emerging**
- Limited English proficiency
- Simple sentences, present tense
- Frequent errors

**Level 3: Developing**
- Developing English proficiency
- Compound sentences emerging
- Errors less frequent

**Level 4: Expanding**
- Strong English proficiency
- Complex sentences
- Academic vocabulary developing

**Level 5: Bridging**
- Advanced English proficiency
- Sophisticated language
- Approaching grade-level proficiency

**Level 6: Reaching**
- Grade-level English proficiency
- Meets exit criteria (reclassified as Former EL)

**Practical Grouping for Scaffolds:**
- **Levels 1-2:** Entering/Emerging - Heavy scaffolds
- **Levels 3-4:** Developing/Expanding - Moderate scaffolds
- **Levels 5-6:** Bridging/Reaching - Light scaffolds

## Universal Scaffolding Strategies (Reused)

**All WIDA levels benefit from:**

- **Visual Supports:** Diagrams, models, graphic organizers
- **Sentence Frames:** More for Levels 1-2, fewer for Levels 5-6
- **Vocabulary Support:** Word walls, cognates, visuals
- **Cooperative Learning:** Structured partner/group work

**See Also:** `/universal/frameworks/eb-scaffolding-guide.md`

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Lowering Content Expectations
**Fix:** Same grade-level content, differentiated language support

### ❌ Mistake 2: Same Scaffolds for All Levels
**Fix:** Differentiate scaffolds - Levels 1-2 need more support than Levels 5-6

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Language Objective
**Fix:** Include both content and language objectives

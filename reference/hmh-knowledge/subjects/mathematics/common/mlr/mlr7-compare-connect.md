# MLR7: Compare and Connect
**Mathematical Language Routine #7**
**Source:** Mathematical Language Routines (MLR) Guidelines
**Primary Use:** Tasks (after solving problems)
**Frequency:** Very High (second most common MLR after MLR6)

---

## Overview

**MLR7: Compare and Connect** fosters students' **meta-awareness** as they identify, compare, and contrast different mathematical approaches, representations, concepts, examples, and language.

**Core Principle:** Understanding deepens when students examine similarities and differences between mathematical ideas.

---

## Purpose

To have students:
1. **Listen** to a partner's solution strategy
2. **Identify** the strategy and key features
3. **Compare** it to their own approach
4. **Contrast** differences between strategies
5. **Connect** underlying mathematical concepts
6. **Evaluate** when each approach might be useful

**Why It Works:**
- Comparing reveals structure that wasn't visible in isolation
- Contrasting highlights critical features
- Multiple valid approaches validate diverse thinking
- Meta-awareness develops flexible mathematical reasoning
- Connections build conceptual understanding

---

## When to Use MLR7

### Best Situations:
- ✅ After solving, when multiple strategies exist
- ✅ When comparing student thinking will deepen understanding
- ✅ When different representations of same concept are available
- ✅ When connecting procedures to concepts is valuable
- ✅ When building flexible strategy selection

### Not Ideal For:
- ❌ When only one strategy makes sense
- ❌ Before students have approaches to compare
- ❌ When time is very limited (needs 7-10 minutes)

---

## Two Main Applications

### Application A: Compare **Strategies/Methods**
Students compare different **ways to solve** the same problem.

**Example:**
- Strategy 1: Area model for 23 × 15
- Strategy 2: Standard algorithm for 23 × 15
- Compare: Both find the same answer, but show different thinking

### Application B: Compare **Terms/Concepts**
Students compare and contrast **vocabulary or mathematical ideas**.

**Example:**
- Concept 1: Perimeter (distance around)
- Concept 2: Area (space inside)
- Compare: Both measure attributes of shapes, but different attributes

## Where to Embed in Into Math TX

### Tasks (After Solving Problem):

**Placement:** "**THEN,** have students use the **Compare and Connect** routine to discuss their thinking."

**Position in Lesson Flow:**
1. Students solve problem (may use different strategies)
2. Students share solutions with partner or class
3. **MLR7 HERE** - Students compare and contrast approaches
4. Whole-class synthesis of connections

---

## Implementation: Application A (Compare Strategies)

### When to Use:
- Multiple solution strategies exist
- Students used different approaches
- Want to highlight mathematical flexibility

### Implementation Steps:

**Step 1: SHARE (Pairs or Small Groups)**
**Time:** 2-3 minutes

Partners share their solution strategies:
- "How did you solve it?"
- Show work and explain thinking
- Both partners share

---

**Step 2: IDENTIFY (Individual Think Time)**
**Time:** 1 minute

Students identify key features of each strategy:
- What steps did each person take?
- What mathematical ideas did each use?
- What representations appeared?

---

**Step 3: COMPARE (Partners)**
**Time:** 3-4 minutes

**Prompts:**
- "How are our strategies similar?"
- "What do they have in common?"
- "Did we both use [mathematical concept]?"

**What to Look For:**
- Underlying mathematical structure (both used place value)
- Common steps (both had to multiply partial products)
- Shared representations (both drew models)

---

**Step 4: CONTRAST (Partners)**
**Time:** 2-3 minutes

**Prompts:**
- "How are our strategies different?"
- "What makes my approach unique?"
- "Which steps were different?"

**What to Look For:**
- Different entry points
- Different representations
- Different efficiency
- Different visibility of concepts

---

**Step 5: CONNECT (Partners or Whole-Class)**
**Time:** 2-3 minutes

**Prompts:**
- "Why do both strategies work?"
- "What mathematical idea connects them?"
- "When might you use one vs. the other?"

**Goal:** Connect specific strategies to broader mathematical concepts

---

### Standard Implementation Text (Strategies):

```
THEN, have students use the Compare and Connect routine to discuss their
thinking.

After students have completed [task parts], have them discuss the two
methods. Ask them which method they liked best and why. [Optional: Point
out connection to mathematical concept]
```

### Example Text (Strategies):

```
THEN, have students use the Compare and Connect routine to discuss their
thinking.

After students have completed Parts C and D, have them discuss the two
methods for simplifying fractions. Ask them which method they liked best
and why. Point out to students that the term *simplify* means to write a
fraction so that the numerator and denominator have no common factors
other than 1.
```

---

## Implementation: Application B (Compare Terms/Concepts)

### When to Use:
- Introducing related vocabulary
- Contrasting commonly confused concepts
- Building conceptual relationships
- Clarifying distinctions

### Implementation Steps:

**Step 1: INTRODUCE (Teacher)**
**Time:** 1-2 minutes

Present two related terms or concepts:
- Define or show examples of each
- Ensure students understand both

---

**Step 2: DESCRIBE (Individual or Pairs)**
**Time:** 2-3 minutes

Students describe each term in their own words:
- "In my own words, [term A] means..."
- "In my own words, [term B] means..."

---

**Step 3: COMPARE (Partners)**
**Time:** 2-3 minutes

**Prompts:**
- "How are [term A] and [term B] similar?"
- "What do they have in common?"
- "Are they both types of [category]?"

---

**Step 4: CONTRAST (Partners)**
**Time:** 2-3 minutes

**Prompts:**
- "How are they different?"
- "When would you use [term A] vs. [term B]?"
- "What's a key difference?"

---

**Step 5: CONNECT (Whole-Class)**
**Time:** 2-3 minutes

**Prompts:**
- "Why is it important to understand both?"
- "How do they work together?"
- "Can you have one without the other?"

---

### Standard Implementation Text (Terms):

```
THEN, have students use the Compare and Connect routine to discuss their
thinking.

Introduce and discuss the new term [vocabulary]. Invite students to
describe [term A] and [term B] in their own words, and then discuss
their descriptions.
```

### Example Text (Terms):

```
THEN, have students use the Compare and Connect routine to discuss their
thinking.

Introduce and discuss the new term *array*. Invite students to describe a
row and a column in their own words, and then discuss their descriptions.
```

---

## Examples by Grade Band

### K-2 Example (Comparing Addition Strategies):

**Context:** Students solved 8 + 7 using different strategies.

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Compare and Connect routine to discuss their
thinking.

Have students share with a partner how they solved 8 + 7. Ask: "How are
your strategies similar? How are they different? Which strategy do you
like better and why?" Connect to the idea that there are many ways to
add, but they all give the same sum.
```

**Possible Strategies:**
- Strategy A: Count on from 8 (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)
- Strategy B: Make a 10 (8 + 2 = 10, then 10 + 5 = 15)
- Strategy C: Doubles (7 + 7 = 14, then 14 + 1 = 15)

**Compare:** All give 15
**Contrast:** Different efficiency, different mental load
**Connect:** All use number relationships and counting

---

### 3-5 Example (Comparing Multiplication Representations):

**Context:** Students represented 4 × 6 in multiple ways.

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Compare and Connect routine to discuss their
thinking.

Have students compare their representations of 4 × 6. Ask: "How are the
area model and the array similar? How are they different? What does 4 × 6
mean in each representation?" Connect to the idea that multiplication can
be shown as equal groups, arrays, or area models, but all show the same
mathematical relationship.
```

**Representations:**
- Array: 4 rows of 6 objects
- Area Model: Rectangle with dimensions 4 by 6
- Repeated Addition: 6 + 6 + 6 + 6

**Compare:** All show 4 groups of 6
**Contrast:** Static (array) vs. measurement (area) vs. operation (repeated addition)
**Connect:** All are models of multiplication

---

### 6-8 Example (Comparing Equation-Solving Strategies):

**Context:** Students solved 3(x + 4) = 24 using different approaches.

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Compare and Connect routine to discuss their
thinking.

After students have solved the equation, have them compare strategies with
a partner. Ask: "What did you do first? Why? How is your approach similar
to or different from your partner's? Which method seems more efficient for
this type of problem?" Connect to the idea that the distributive property
and division are inverse operations, and different orders can both work.
```

**Strategies:**
- Strategy A: Distribute first: 3x + 12 = 24, then solve
- Strategy B: Divide both sides by 3 first: x + 4 = 8, then solve

**Compare:** Both arrive at x = 4
**Contrast:** Different first step, different number of steps
**Connect:** Both rely on inverse operations and properties of equality

## Teacher Facilitation Strategies

### Structuring the Comparison:

**Use Visual Organizers:**

**Venn Diagram:**
```
  Strategy A          Both          Strategy B
┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│ Area model  │  │ Find    │  │ Standard    │
│ Shows       │  │ 23×15   │  │ algorithm   │
│ partial     │  │ Use     │  │ Works for   │
│ products    │  │ place   │  │ any numbers │
│ visually    │  │ value   │  │ Efficient   │
└─────────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────────┘
```

**T-Chart:**
```
Similarities          |  Differences
─────────────────────┼──────────────────────
Both find area       |  Array shows objects
Both count square    |  Area model shows
  units              |    dimensions
Both use rows/cols   |  Array is discrete
                     |  Area is continuous
```

---

### Questioning Strategies:

**Compare Questions (Similarities):**
- "What mathematical idea do both strategies use?"
- "Did you both have to [key step]?"
- "How are these representations connected?"
- "What's the same about these approaches?"

**Contrast Questions (Differences):**
- "What makes your strategy unique?"
- "Which strategy is more efficient? Why?"
- "Which strategy shows the concept more clearly?"
- "When might one approach be better than another?"

**Connect Questions (Big Ideas):**
- "Why do both strategies work mathematically?"
- "What property or concept connects these approaches?"
- "How does this relate to what we learned before?"
- "What does this tell us about [concept]?"

---

### Common Challenges & Solutions:

**Challenge 1: "We both did it the same way."**

**Solution:** Dig deeper to find subtle differences.
- "Did you draw the same model?"
- "Did you start with the same step?"
- "Did you write your work the same way?"

Or: Compare to a strategy the teacher presents.
- "Here's another way a student might solve this. How does it compare to yours?"

---

**Challenge 2: Students focus only on differences, miss commonalities.**

**Solution:** Explicitly prompt for similarities first.
- "Before we talk about differences, let's find at least 3 ways these are similar."
- Use Venn diagram to structure (overlapping section = similarities)

---

**Challenge 3: Students judge "right" vs. "wrong" instead of comparing features.**

**Solution:** Reframe as analysis, not evaluation.
- "Both strategies are valid. Let's analyze what makes each one unique."
- "Instead of 'better or worse,' let's think about 'when would you use this?'"

---

**Challenge 4: Comparison stays superficial.**

**Solution:** Push for deeper mathematical connections.
- "Why does Strategy A work?"
- "What mathematical property allows Strategy B to work?"
- "How are these both examples of [concept]?"

---

## Assessment Opportunities

### Formative Assessment:

**What to Observe:**
- Can students identify similarities?
- Can students articulate differences?
- Do students connect to underlying concepts?
- Do students evaluate when strategies are useful?

**Evidence of Success:**
- ✅ Students notice structural similarities across strategies
- ✅ Students articulate why both strategies work
- ✅ Students make strategic choices based on problem features
- ✅ Students use comparison language precisely

---

### Exit Ticket Options:

**Option 1: Compare Two Strategies**
"Strategy A and Strategy B both solve [problem]. Write one similarity and one difference between them."

**Option 2: Preference with Justification**
"Which strategy do you prefer for [problem type]? Why? When might you use the other strategy instead?"

**Option 3: Connection to Concept**
"Both strategies work because they both use [concept]. Explain how each strategy uses this concept."

---

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Students Who Struggle with Comparison:

**Scaffold with Structure:**
- Provide Venn diagram or T-chart template
- Give specific prompts: "Look at the first step in each..."
- Model one comparison before asking students to do more
- Focus on one aspect (just similarities OR just differences)

**Simplify:**
- Compare just 2 strategies (not 3+)
- Start with obvious differences before subtle ones
- Use visual representations (easier to compare than abstract)

---

### For Advanced Students:

**Increase Complexity:**
- Compare 3+ strategies simultaneously
- Analyze efficiency, generalizability, conceptual clarity
- Create original strategy that combines features
- Connect to broader mathematical concepts

**Example Extension:**
"Create a new strategy that combines the visual clarity of the area model with the efficiency of the standard algorithm."

---

## Time Management

### Typical Timing:

**Total Time:** 7-10 minutes

| Step | Time | Activity |
|------|------|----------|
| Share strategies | 2-3 min | Partners explain approaches |
| Compare (similarities) | 2-3 min | Discuss what's the same |
| Contrast (differences) | 2-3 min | Discuss what's different |
| Connect (concepts) | 2-3 min | Link to big ideas |
| **Total** | **8-12 min** | **Complete routine** |

---

### Shortened Version (5 minutes):

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Using when only one strategy makes sense
**Problem:** Nothing to compare
**Solution:** Use only when multiple valid approaches exist

### ❌ Mistake 2: Focusing only on "which is better"
**Problem:** Comparative judgment, not analysis
**Solution:** Analyze when each is useful, not declare winner

### ❌ Mistake 3: Comparing before students have strategies
**Problem:** Students haven't solved yet
**Solution:** Always place AFTER problem-solving

### ❌ Mistake 4: Superficial comparison ("they're different")
**Problem:** No mathematical insight gained
**Solution:** Push for HOW and WHY they're different

### ❌ Mistake 5: Skipping the connection to concepts
**Problem:** Comparison stays procedural
**Solution:** Explicitly connect to underlying mathematical ideas

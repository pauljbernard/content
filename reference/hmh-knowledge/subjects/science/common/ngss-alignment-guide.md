# NGSS Alignment Guide
**Next Generation Science Standards for K-8 Science**
**Scope:** Subject-Common (widely adopted across multiple states)
**Audience:** Curriculum developers creating science instructional materials

---

## Overview

**NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards)** are K-12 science content standards adopted by 20 states and the District of Columbia, with many other states using them as models. NGSS emphasizes three-dimensional learning: integrating disciplinary core ideas, science practices, and crosscutting concepts.

**Core Principle:** Students learn science by doing science—engaging in practices that scientists and engineers use while building understanding of core ideas through the lens of crosscutting concepts.

---

## NGSS vs. State-Specific Science Standards

### Adoption Status:

**States Using NGSS (20+ states):**
- California
- Washington
- Oregon
- Illinois
- New Jersey
- Maryland
- Rhode Island
- Vermont
- And others

**States with NGSS-Aligned Standards:**
- Many states not formally adopting NGSS use similar frameworks
- Florida: NGSSS (Next Generation Sunshine State Standards) - similar structure
- Texas: TEKS Science - different organization but overlapping content

**This Guide Focuses on:** NGSS as the subject-common framework (most widely adopted)

**State-Specific Files:** Texas and Florida science would have district-specific alignment files

## NGSS Three-Dimensional Learning

### The Three Dimensions:

**Dimension 1: Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs)**
- What scientists and engineers do
- 8 practices students engage in

**Dimension 2: Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs)**
- What students should know
- Core content in physical, life, Earth/space sciences and engineering

**Dimension 3: Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs)**
- Lenses for understanding
- 7 concepts that span all domains of science

**Integration is Key:** All three dimensions taught together, not separately

---

## Dimension 1: Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs)

### Eight Practices:

**1. Asking Questions and Defining Problems**
- Students pose testable questions (science)
- Define problems to solve (engineering)

**2. Developing and Using Models**
- Create representations of phenomena
- Use models to predict and explain

**3. Planning and Carrying Out Investigations**
- Design experiments
- Collect data systematically

**4. Analyzing and Interpreting Data**
- Organize and analyze data
- Identify patterns and relationships

**5. Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking**
- Apply math to describe phenomena
- Use computational tools

**6. Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions**
- Construct evidence-based explanations (science)
- Design solutions to problems (engineering)

**7. Engaging in Argument from Evidence**
- Defend claims with evidence
- Critique others' arguments

**8. Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information**
- Read scientific texts critically
- Communicate findings clearly

**Note:** Similar to CCSS-M Mathematical Practices and ELA literacy standards—these are "habits of mind" that cut across content

---

## Dimension 2: Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs)

### Four Domains:

**PS: Physical Science**
- PS1: Matter and Its Interactions
- PS2: Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions
- PS3: Energy
- PS4: Waves and Their Applications

**LS: Life Science**
- LS1: From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes
- LS2: Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics
- LS3: Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits
- LS4: Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity

**ESS: Earth and Space Sciences**
- ESS1: Earth's Place in the Universe
- ESS2: Earth's Systems
- ESS3: Earth and Human Activity

**ETS: Engineering, Technology, and Applications of Science**
- ETS1: Engineering Design
- ETS2: Links Among Engineering, Technology, Science, and Society (middle school only)

**Progression:** Core ideas develop across grade bands (K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12)

---

## Dimension 3: Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs)

### Seven Concepts:

**1. Patterns**
- Observed patterns lead to questions and models
- Example: Day/night patterns, seasons

**2. Cause and Effect**
- Events have causes
- Testing ideas about causality

**3. Scale, Proportion, and Quantity**
- Size, time, energy matter
- Comparing magnitudes

**4. Systems and System Models**
- Defining system boundaries
- Modeling interactions

**5. Energy and Matter**
- Flows, cycles, and conservation
- Tracking through systems

**6. Structure and Function**
- Form follows function
- Shapes and structures relate to what they do

**7. Stability and Change**
- Conditions for stability
- Mechanisms of change

**Application:** Every lesson should highlight at least one crosscutting concept as a lens for understanding

---

## NGSS Performance Expectations (PEs)

### Standard Format:

**Performance Expectation = SEP + DCI + CCC (integrated)**

**Example:** `3-LS1-1`
- `3` = Grade 3
- `LS1` = Life Science, Core Idea 1 (From Molecules to Organisms)
- `1` = First PE within that core idea

**Full PE:**
```
3-LS1-1
Use data to provide evidence that plants and animals have traits inherited
from parents and that variation of these traits exists in a group of similar
organisms.

[Clarification Statement: Focus on organisms other than humans.]
[Assessment Boundary: Not assessment of genetic mechanisms of inheritance]
```

**Breakdown:**
- **SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data (implicit in "use data to provide evidence")
- **DCI:** LS1.B: Growth and Development of Organisms
- **CCC:** Patterns (implicit in identifying inherited traits)

**Complexity:** PEs describe what students can do, integrating all three dimensions

---

## Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER) Framework

### Science Writing Structure:

**Claim:**
- Answer to the question
- Statement of what you learned

**Evidence:**
- Data from investigation
- Observations, measurements

**Reasoning:**
- Explanation of how evidence supports claim
- Connects to scientific principles

**Example:**

**Question:** How do we know the mystery material is iron?

**Claim:** The mystery material is iron.

**Evidence:** The material was attracted to a magnet, had a metallic luster, and had a density of 7.8 g/cm³.

**Reasoning:** These properties match the known properties of iron. Iron is magnetic, has a metallic appearance, and has a density of about 7.9 g/cm³. Our measured density is very close to the established density of iron.

**CER Scaffolds:**
- Sentence frames for each component
- Graphic organizers
- Models of strong CER responses

**See Also:** `/universal/frameworks/sentence-frames-library.md` (science section)

**Assessment Principles:**
- Assess students' ability to use practices (not just recall facts)
- Integrate dimensions (not separately)
- Performance tasks over multiple-choice when possible
- Open-ended items with rubrics

**See Also:**
- `/universal/assessment/item-writing-best-practices.md`
- `/universal/assessment/scoring-rubrics-guide.md`

## Common NGSS Implementation Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Teaching Dimensions Separately

**Problem:** Monday = learn about force (DCI), Tuesday = practice graphing (SEP), Wednesday = talk about cause/effect (CCC)

**Fix:** Integrate all three dimensions in every lesson
- Students engage in practices while learning content through the lens of crosscutting concepts

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Frontloading Vocabulary

**Problem:** Spend whole lesson defining terms before doing science

**Fix:** Introduce vocabulary in context during investigation
- Learn "hypothesis" while making hypotheses
- Define "erosion" after observing erosion models

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Confirmation Labs

**Problem:** Students follow step-by-step instructions to confirm known information

**Fix:** Open inquiry where students:
- Ask their own questions
- Design investigations
- Analyze results (may not match expected)

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Assessing Only DCIs

**Problem:** Tests ask "What is photosynthesis?" but not "Construct an explanation..."

**Fix:** Assess ability to use practices with content
- Performance tasks
- CER writing
- Rubrics for practices (not just content)

---

## State-Level Variation

### States Using NGSS Directly:
- Use PE codes exactly (5-PS1-3)
- Materials can be universal for these states

### States with NGSS-Aligned Standards:
- Content similar, different codes
- May need code mapping document

### States with Different Standards (Texas, Florida pre-NGSSS):
- Different organization
- Significant content overlap but need state-specific files

---

**Remember:** NGSS represents a paradigm shift in science education—from learning about science to doing science. Three-dimensional learning means always integrating practices, core ideas, and crosscutting concepts. The architecture supports this by allowing massive reuse of universal scaffolding strategies (EB support, UDL, assessment) and literacy routines, with only science-specific content requiring new files. When you design for NGSS, you're designing for inquiry-based, evidence-driven science instruction that prepares students to think like scientists.

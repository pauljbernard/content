## Overview

Economics examines how individuals, businesses, and governments make choices about scarce resources. Students analyze markets, economic systems, fiscal and monetary policy, and personal finance.

**College/Career Readiness:** Economics is essential for business, finance, public policy, and informed citizenship in a market economy.

**State Requirements:** Economics is often required or part of combined Government/Economics course.

**AP Economics:** Two separate courses—AP Macroeconomics (national/global economy) and AP Microeconomics (individual/firm decisions)

## Key Concepts

### 1. Economic Fundamentals

- Scarcity and choice
- Opportunity cost
- Trade-offs
- Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)
- Comparative and absolute advantage
- Economic systems (traditional, command, market, mixed)

### 2. Microeconomics (Individual and Firm Behavior)

**Supply and Demand:**
- Law of demand, law of supply
- Equilibrium price and quantity
- Shifts in supply/demand (determinants)
- Elasticity (price elasticity of demand/supply, income elasticity, cross-price elasticity)

**Market Structures:**
- Perfect competition
- Monopoly
- Monopolistic competition
- Oligopoly

**Production and Costs:**
- Factors of production (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship)
- Marginal cost, marginal revenue
- Profit maximization
- Law of diminishing marginal returns

**Factor Markets:**
- Labor market (wages, employment)
- Capital market (interest rates)
- Derived demand

**Market Failures:**
- Externalities (positive, negative)
- Public goods
- Role of government (regulation, taxes, subsidies)

### 3. Macroeconomics (National and Global Economy)

**National Income and GDP:**
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- Nominal vs. real GDP
- GDP deflator, CPI (Consumer Price Index)
- Economic growth

**Unemployment:**
- Types (frictional, structural, cyclical)

## Quick Reference

**Every Economics Material Must:**
- Teach fundamental concepts (scarcity, opportunity cost, supply/demand)
- (Micro) Analyze market structures and firm behavior
- (Macro) Analyze fiscal and monetary policy
- Include personal finance (regular Economics)
- Use graphs and data analysis
- (AP) Align to AP Macro/Micro CED
- Connect to current economic issues

**Remember:** Economics is the study of choice. Understanding economics empowers students to make informed personal financial decisions and evaluate public policy.

                 Digital & Print Parity

Digital & Print Parity has become a one of the foundational stories for content in our math programs. When authoring items in
Learnosity, you should consider ways to make the print and digital versions as similar as possible.

Defining Parity

     We define parity by referencing a user experience. Consider a teacher who is projecting the digital activity for a lesson on the
     board and a student who is following along in their print student edition. For an item that shows perfect parity between print
     and digital versions, the answers to all of the following should be YES:

           Would the student be able to quickly and easily tell that they are on the same item as the teacher?
           Would the student know exactly what/where to write in their student edition if the teacher inputs an answer into the

                digital item?
           Would the student understand how to interact with the item in print given the interaction in digital?

     Therefore, an item's parity between print and digital can be considered in 3 layers (more info on the following pages):

          1. Parity of Question Structure/Layout
          2. Parity of Answer Structure/Layout
          3. Parity of Interaction

     When considering a current item in one of our programs for digital and print parity, we will not default to always editing print to
     match or always editing digital to match. Depending on the situation, either one or both may require revision. Thus, our
     overarching goal statement is as follows:

          Approach the content and interaction choices in a way that meets the needs of the standard it's addressing and
          maintains the rigor of the problem in both digital & print with parity.

Rules for all 3 Parity Levels

      Strive for ALL 3 levels of parity in ALL items in ALL components.
                o A few situations may present challenges to achieving parity of answer structure/layout or interaction specifically.
                     All items can achieve parity of question structure/layout.

      Consult the specific wording of the learning standards to determine when a particular interaction is necessary.

Core Math Notes                           decision: April 2024

        Conversations throughout Q4 of 2023 and Q1 of 2024 allowed for stakeholders (LXD, DDP, and PM&S) to make
decisions about best practices for authoring print and digital items in tandem for all programs (from this point
forward). With development of a new program version on the horizon, decisions were made to promote parity
between print and digital formats of items.

        Though the main driver of this decision to push for parity is based on user feedback that print and digital don't
always match, we also set out to reduce the feeling of "wordiness" on the screen in the digital activity. We do this
with adding whitespace on the print page for students to represent their thinking and choosing appropriate
interactions in digital. Coupled with print and digital parity, we aim for a much simpler, error-free experience for
classrooms which continually switch between print and digital versions of components.

                       Digital & Print Parity (cont.)

Parity of Question Structure/Layout
          Digital and print versions of an item show this first layer of parity when the visual structures of the questions are the same.
          In all cases, items can achieve parity of question structure. Consider how print and digital can be authored together to
          create a similar interaction. See a BEFORE and AFTER example below:

Parity?                                   Print        Digital
                                                       BEFORE

   NO - in print,      BEFORE
   students draw

     models and
     interpret a
 remainder on the
write-on line, but in
  digital, some of
  these things are
 done in separate
parts. These LOOK
like different items.

                                                       AFTER

                       AFTER

YES - with edits to

 parity of question

   structure was
      ACHIEVED

 (note: columns in
multi-part items are

   an acceptable
   deviance from
  parity to reduce

      scrolling)

Here are a few other NON-PARITY examples of question structure that would need to be addressed:

     X In print, students see a stem and question; in digital, they see a stem, question, and digital-specific direction line.
     X In print, students are asked to give an answer and explain on one write-on line; in digital, they see a multi-part question

          with extra direction lines and a part A for the answer and part B for the explanation.
     X In print, students see a stem and direction line as one paragraph; in digital, the stem and direction line are separated.

                       Digital & Print Parity (cont.)

Parity of Answer Structure/Layout
          Digital and print versions of an item show this second layer of parity when the way in which students interact with the item
          is the same. In all cases, items can achieve parity of question structure. Consider how print and digital can be authored
          together to create a similar interaction. See a BEFORE and AFTER example below:

      Parity?           Print                          Digital
                       BEFORE                          BEFORE
    NO - in print,
students are circling

     and boxing
   pictures, but in
digital, students are
sorting pictures into
   categories. The
  answers will not
   look the same.

                                                       AFTER

YES - with edits to    AFTER
 print and digital,
 parity of answer

   structure was
     ACHIEVED

Here are a few other NON-PARITY examples of answer structure that would need to be addressed:

     X In print, students give an answer and explain on one write-on line; in digital, they fill in the blanks on a preset explanation.
     X In print, students give an answer on a write-on line, but in digital, they choose from a list of 4 possible answers.

                   Digital & Print Parity (cont.)

Parity of Interaction
          Digital and print versions of an item show this third level of parity when students interact with version in the same way. In
          most cases, items can achieve parity of interaction. Consider how print and digital can be authored together to create a
          similar interaction. See a BEFORE and AFTER example below:

   Parity?          Print                          Digital
                   BEFORE                          BEFORE

 (in addition,
direction lines

    differ)

YES - with edits

  as direction

Here are a few other NON-PARITY examples of interactions that would need to be addressed:

     X In print, students explain their thinking with a paragraph, but in digital, they complete a sentence with drop downs.
     X In print, students draw a model, but in digital, they select the correct model from a list.

Core Math Notes                                          decision: April 2024

        We have discontinued the authoring of digital-specific direction lines (DLs) on Learnosity items. Our
interactions are either intuitive enough that these DLs just add unneeded noise to the screen or prompt us to choose
better interactions for specific questions so that the stems naturally hint at the interaction.

This sample set of print/digital items shows the digital adaptations for some of the tricky parity situations we've found in Into Math
v1. Information about how to structure an item has been included after each scenario. The structures and ideas shown are
applicable to many types of items and mathematical concepts across all grades. In many of these situations, we can avoid a
"drawing" or "essay" interaction by thinking creatively about a special use case for a question type that can be autoscored.

Every manually scored scenario that we can efficaciously convert to an autoscored item will save teachers time and effort.
Samples are shown on the next 4 pages. To preview the digital, WebCMS versions of these items, use this link.

Notice:                                                                      [Get the WebCMS source code here.]

                 In simple addition or representation situations, the draggers in the digital item are images of a
                 physical manipulative to simulate this modeling step. A good verb to use in the direction line
                 (which works in print or digital) is "show" or "make."

Implementation:  Turn on "Duplicate responses" and keep the frame at one row, one column. Then depending on
                 the question, validate multiple variations if students model the reverse of the answer (e.g.
                 modelling 9 + 6 instead of 6 + 9 in counters) or an alternative correct solution (e.g. using ten
                 circles instead of one line in quick pictures).

Other Scenarios:  Base 10 block models

         The Classification type can allow for multiple frames (e.g. as needed in a division or grouping
         problem) or special draggers (e.g. a crossed-out counter to model subtraction).

Implementation: Turn on "Duplicate responses" and set the appropriate rows and columns. One column or row
                        could even have the title "remainder" if needed to model a division problem.

Other Scenarios:  Tally charts

Notice:          The direction lines here use the verb "show" rather than "draw" (print-centric) or "drag" (digital-
                 centric). Bar models can be easily requested as tech art if the template is given to students. If
                 students must draw their own bar model, it may need to be a Drawing item.

Implementation:  All of these examples are Label Image with Drag & Drop to allow students to drag in what they
                 may have had to draw on a print page. Specify in the art request the width of the art or a
                 transparent background for a dragger.

                    Sample Print Item                         Sample Digital Item

                                           [Get the WebCMS source code here.]

                    Notice:                                                              [Get the WebCMS source code here.]

                             The vertical equations in the digital item have separate response boxes for each place value
                             including the regrouping above addition, subtraction, and multiplication equations. The print
                             item provides the vertical equation (black text and blank space or write in boxes) the same way
                             as digital.

Implementation: We can construct vertical equations with tables in Learnosity. We enable the table styles of
                        "Exclude all borders" and "Content width" to achieve the styles shown here.

Manually Scored Situations

     Though there are many possibilities for creating models or representing thinking in Learnosity, there are still quite a few
     situations where a Drawing interaction might be necessary:

           Bar models (where students are actually drawing the whole model from scratch not just labeling an existing bar model
                template)

           Number lines (where students have to make the ticks or label the ticks and plot something on them)
           Analog clocks (where students have to draw hands on a clock)

                                            Parts should be placed in the right column.
                                            Enable Show vertical divider.
                                            Leave scrolling for long content disabled.
                                            Parts should be labeled with bold uppercase
                                               letters and a period.

Other Rules
      Keypads All keypads should always be set to the Block on focus type.
      Units All units used in answer lines (unless explicitly stated in the standard language) should be provided for the student in
          print and digital (i.e. <response box> units).
      Scaling For the Math question type, the Template Font Scale field should be set to Normal (100%).

Core Math Notes                        decision: March 2024

        Conversations throughout March 2024 allowed for stakeholders (LXD, DDP, and PM&S) to make decisions
about the visual styling and format of Learnosity items in general for all programs (from this point forward). These
decisions are in addition to the previously explained aspects of digital/print parity and direction lines. The main UX
goals behind these decisions are conciseness and minimum scrolling within an item.

The following authoring decisions are now obsolete and are NOT part of our best practices moving forward:
   Using "DIRECTIONS: Use the information to answer Parts A-C." as a boilerplate above the stem.
   Labelling question parts with "Part A" followed by a hard return. (see above for change)
   Using Block as the default keypad type. (see above for change)
   Using single column authoring for all items. (see above for multi-part items)
   Using digital specific direction lines/verbs. (see Direction Lines)
   Representing an "explain your answer" question in print with a fill-in-the-blank type in digital, as one example.

                               Scoring

Learnosity Scoring Story for All Math Programs
      We will continue to use 2 points as the maximum for all question types.
                o Example 1: multi-part items (Part A & Part B, for example) receive 2 points per part/interaction - this means the
                     total item will be worth a multiple of two points.
                o Example 2: a single math question/interaction with three response boxes is worth 2 points (for the entire
                     interaction) so each response box is worth 0.66 points.
      We will allow for Partial match scoring on the question types listed in the table below.
      We will NO LONGER use rounding to adjust a partial match score - instead we will choose None for the rounding field, and
          the system will display a decimal value of points earned out of 2 for each question (for students and teachers) on Ed
          reporting. This is the most accurate method for reporting scores.
      We will allow for 1 non-autoscored item per component per lesson. Manually scored items will require a rubric.
      Question types like Multiple Response will also require the use of the Penalty Points field to validate correctly (denoted by
          an * in the table below). See the sections for these question types for more details.

                                    Rubrics

With the implementation of manually scored items inside math projects, rubrics are required to assist with teacher scoring on the Ed
platform. Two boilerplate rubrics have been loaded into all WebCMS math projects for use in items under the names Math GK-12
Essay 2-point and Math GK-12 Drawing 2-point rubric. Add a rubric in the rubrics tab to customize:

                                             Rules:
                                                 Each manually scored question must include a 2-point
                                                  rubric for teachers to use in scoring the item.
                                                 Each description for each point designation of a
                                                  rubric must contain a boilerplate sentence (preset in

                                                  added at time of authoring).
                                                 One manually scored item can be authored per
                                                  component per lesson depending on learning
                                                  standard requirements.

                                        Feedback & Hints

There are three types of components used with Learnosity: practice, ancillary, and assessment. Hints and feedback are authored
only for practice and ancillary questions.

Feedback

Feedback surfaces to students when the student checks their answer and they've answered something incorrectly (except in
Multiple Choice question types). Navigate to the next page to view example feedback sentence stems you can use to write feedback
for a question.

Hints

A student can choose to view a hint before answering or while answering a question. Based on feedback from teachers, we've
compiled some tips for writing good hints. Hints are acceptable if they:

      do not give away the answer directly
      are in the form of a question or statement that is age-appropriate
      match the style, and in some cases, the exact wording of student questioning or teacher scripting from the print TE
      possibly suggest a strategy for solving (i.e. "Try drawing a model for the problem to find the exact remainder")

Example 1     Example 1 Hints        Example 2     Example 2 Hints

           1) The problem gave                  1) Look at the first
           you Jason's total                    model. How many blue
           money and he needs to                cubes are in the cube
           split it up into equal               train? How many white
           groups of $0.79. Which               cubes are there?
           operation is that?
                                                2) Look at the second
           2) Use x to represent                model. If you take apart
           the unknown - the                    the 2 white cubes, how
           number of cans of                    many blue cubes are left
           beans Jason can buy.                 in the cube train?

Feedback and Hints Rules

      Every practice or ancillary question receives 1 feedback per question or 1 feedback per response and 2 hints
      Hints and feedback are written in second person perspective.
      Hints and feedback should be written in a casual, warm tone to help the student stay motivated to learn.
      Hints and feedback CAN contain LaTeX.
      Feedback is almost always authored to address a student mistake.
      Feedback consists of a boilerplate sentence stem and a custom hint (which can be repurposed in a hint field).

Use Cases & Parity
    The stem, direction line, question format, answer format, and interaction should be the same for both print and
    digital so that a student answering the question in either medium will have the same experience:

                             Description: The Math question type allows for students
                             to input math as a response with advanced auto-scoring
                             capabilities.

Compose the Question

    Direction Lines
           Some questions include directions specific to the question which come after the problem stem.

Grade   Direction Line Text        Sample Direction Line
K - 2          NONE                             N/A

3 - 12  NONE                       N/A

Formula Template
         o Structure response boxes to mirror Write On Lines (WOLs) in print.
         o Do not require students to enter text units (i.e. counters, inches, etc.)
                    In most cases, provide the unit as text in the template outside of the response box / WOL.
                    You can require students to enter the appropriate unit if (1) the keypad has that unit available
                        and (2) the standard language requires it (rare use case).

Set correct answer(s)
         o Worth 2 Point(s)
         o See Validation Methods for detailed instructions on how to set up autoscoring correctly.

category names will affect validation. Therefore, the only interaction here is students
adjusting bar heights to match a set of data.

Use Cases & Parity
    The stem, direction line, question format, answer format, and interaction should be the same for both print and
    digital so that a student answering the question in either medium will have the same experience:

Use Case Print                                                                 Digital

Represent categorical data in        Note: there is a break in parity of
   a bar graph                     interaction between print and digital,
                               but that is acceptable for this question type.

                                            Description: The Dot Plot question type allows students
                                            to create a line plot by adjusting a number of dots above
                                            a number line for a set of categories.

Use Cases & Parity
    The stem, direction line, question format, answer format, and interaction should be the same for both print and
    digital so that a student answering the question in either medium will have the same experience:

Use Case Print                                                            Digital

Represent numerical data        Note: there is a break in parity of
   in a dot plot              interaction between print and digital,
                          but that is acceptable for this question type.

                                         Description: The Line Plot question type allows students
                                         to create a line plot by adjusting a number of Xs above a
                                         number line for a set of categories.

         o Set the Max Y value for the line plot.
                    Note: The interval for the y-axis is dependent upon this value and not changeable - this will
                        affect how the item should appear in print for parity).

Use Cases & Parity
    The stem, direction line, question format, answer format, and interaction should be the same for both print and
    digital so that a student answering the question in either medium will have the same experience:

Use Case Print                                                                 Digital

Represent numerical data in a        Note: there is a break in parity of

                               but that is acceptable for this question type.

Rules for validation methods:

      For some items to validate correctly, you may have to add multiple conditions for a single response box using multiple
          methods above (see Complex Validation Examples for use cases).

      Use an Alternate answer when you need to validate another non-equivalent answer to the original correct value as correct
          (acts as an OR logical operator).

      Use + Add Condition when you need to put another restriction on the original correct value (acts as AND operator).
      If you use the Response container formula template field to structure the answer, print must also have that formatting -

          otherwise, edit the keypad and validation methods to allow students to generate their own structure correctly.

Using the Response container formula template:

Use Case:   Ratios / Time                       Fractions                Ordered Pairs            Equation

Example:

 This is beneficial for considering the entire time, ratio, ordered pair, or equation as a single response rather than separate
     parts (since it wouldn't make sense to score the boxes separately).

 But most of the time, to maintain parity with digital, we would default to providing the single response box and add the
     appropriate buttons to the keypad to allow students to structure their own answer. This requires more robust validation
     methods (see the following pages).

                                  Source Code

Because the default settings when creating a new item and the settings mentioned in this document differ slightly for every question
type, it can become quite laborious to have to click down through multiple, pre-determined, best practice options when authoring
anew.

Once you have become more familiar with authoring, there is a more efficient way to build to build items using the source code.
Templates which are already aligned to the specifications required by this item guide have been provided in each question type
section to kick start the authoring process for new items.

Using the Source Code Templates
          At the end of each question type section, you will find a set of source code templates which can be used to set a new
          question to the proper format and settings BEFORE you add specific content:

                                               In the Item Editor, click the </> Source button
                                               located in the row below the save button:

                                                                                        Copy the entire source code from the appropriate
                                                                                        column of the table in this guide, and then paste it
                                                                                        in the dialog box of WebCMS and press "Apply".

Though these source code templates include references to the "Check" button depending on the type of activity, they do
not account for quite a few settings which will have to be set manually while authoring including (but not limited to)
feedback, hints, keypads, or scoring & validation changes (for various use cases).

Copying this source code is the first step - then refer to the remaining details in that question type's section of the guide for
all remaining considerations.

For reference, the question type codes are listed on the next page.

Using the Source code, you can also efficiently change the type of a question without having to delete it and start anew.
This is helpful for maintaining Additional Attributes, Media, and Alignments settings that you have already assigned to the
question. To change a question's type, click the </> Source button below the SAVE button, replace the text in the "type"
field with the desired type, and Apply changes.

Note: This does not work in all situations. Always make sure to recheck the validation and all settings of an item after
attempting to change its type using this method.

                                        Keypads

All Math question types require the use of a keypad to assist students with entering their answers in response boxes. This is
especially relevant for students taking Learnosity activities on a tablet with no native keyboard. For consistency across grades and
programs, we've developed a set of required specifications for all keypads.

Keypad Specifications
     Specifications which may need to be changed from default during authoring are starred ().

Type                           Leave at Block on focus
Show keypad hints              Set to disabled
Enable horizontal keypad       Leave disabled
Number pad                     Should be customized based on the required answer (see below)
                               Remove Group 1 and Group 2
Symbols                        Can be customized based on the required answer (see below)

Customizing the Number Pad
Depending on the format of the answer, a specific type of keypad should be used. Some examples are shown:

Numerical                 Large Number  K-2 Equation       3-12 Equation with                              3-12 Equation with
                            or Decimal                           Whole #s                                        Decimals

 Note: The vertical order of the operation keys shown here (+ -  ) differs from the system default (  - +).

Customizing the Symbols
Depending on the format of the answer, a specific set of symbols can be used. Some examples are shown:

Fraction or Mixed         Money with    Inequalities with  3-12 Linear Equations                           3-12 Equation with
     Number                Decimals         Decimals                                                             PEMDAS

Customized Symbols Rules:

          o Set the label to \Sigma and leave the Title [blank]
      Only include symbols relevant to the answer for the equation
          o Consider the forms a student may chose to represent their answer (i.e. fraction, mixed number etc.)

To conform with Accessibility guidelines for digital authoring, there are a few things to remember. Please see the specific sections
below and on the next page for information:

Tables
          We will NO LONGER author tables as tech art. Screen reading devices benefit from the native tables built inside the item
          editor. Tables can include LaTeX or response boxes if desired; use the following settings for consistency:

          Horizontal Tables                                      Vertical Tables

Alt Text
          For placed tech art pieces, please refer to the Alt Text Guidelines for authoring appropriate alternative text.

ARIA Labels

          ARIA label fields in the item settings allow the author to manually set the alternative text for a particular component of the
          item.

In most cases, these are automatically generated and acceptable for use on the Ed Platform. In some rare cases, we may
edit the ARIA labels manually to provide a better experience for students using screen readers:

the equation editor. See example below.

Though there is much to learn about custom coding with LaTeX, most of what we need to create for Learnosity items can be done
with the equation editor. Access the equation editor in most text entry fields by clicking the sigma button:

Beyond using the keypad to build equations, consider referencing the resources mentioned below.

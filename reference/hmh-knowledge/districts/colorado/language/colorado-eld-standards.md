# Colorado ELD Standards
**Colorado English Language Development Standards**
**Source:** Colorado Department of Education
**Applies To:** K-12 (Colorado only)

---

## Overview

**Colorado has state-specific ELD standards** but uses WIDA ACCESS assessment. This unique combination means materials should reference CO ELD standards while being aware that assessment is via WIDA ACCESS.

**Assessment:** WIDA ACCESS for ELLs | **Levels:** 5 levels (1-5, Bridged) | **Standards:** CO-specific framework

## CO ELD vs. Other Frameworks

| Aspect | Colorado | WIDA States | CA/WA/OR |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Proficiency Levels** | 5 levels (1-5, Bridged) | 6 levels (1.0-6.0) | 3-5 levels (varies) |
| **Assessment** | WIDA ACCESS | WIDA ACCESS | ELPAC/ELPA21 |
| **Standards Framework** | CO-specific | WIDA consortium | State-specific |

**Unique Feature:** Uses WIDA assessment but own standards framework

## CO ELD Proficiency Levels

**Level 1: Beginning**
- Minimal English proficiency
- Single words, short phrases
- Heavy scaffolds needed

**Level 2: Early Intermediate**
- Limited English
- Simple sentences
- Strong scaffolds

**Level 3: Intermediate**
- Developing English
- Compound sentences
- Moderate scaffolds

**Level 4: Early Advanced**
- Strong English
- Complex sentences
- Light scaffolds

**Level 5: Advanced → Bridged**
- Advanced English, approaching grade-level
- Sophisticated language
- Minimal scaffolds
- "Bridged" = meets exit criteria

## Scaffolding by Proficiency Level

### Math Example: Grade 5 Fractions

**Levels 1-2 (Beginning/Early Intermediate):**
- Visual: Fraction models with labels
- Sentence frames: "The answer is ___." / "Maria has ___ left."
- Word bank with pictures
- Partner work with manipulatives

**Level 3 (Intermediate):**
- Graphic organizer for steps
- Sentence frames: "First I ___. Then I ___."
- Vocabulary support: remaining, difference, subtract
- Small group discussion

**Levels 4-5 (Early Advanced/Advanced):**
- Optional visual supports
- Encourage academic precision: "common denominator," "equivalent fractions"
- Extended explanations
- Full class discussion

## CO ELD and Mathematical Language Routines

**MLRs provide scaffolds for all CO ELD levels:**

- **MLR1-MLR8:** Support language development across proficiency levels
- Levels 1-2: Heavy scaffolds (frames, visuals)
- Level 3: Moderate scaffolds (organizers, vocabulary)
- Levels 4-5: Light scaffolds (academic language models)

**See:** `/subjects/mathematics/common/mlr/` for all MLR files

## Implementation Notes

**Required Elements:**

**1. Content Standard**
```
CAS.Math.5.NF.A.1
Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators
```

**2. Language Objective**
```
Students will explain their strategy using "first," "then," and "common denominator."
```

**3. Proficiency-Level Scaffolds**
- Differentiate for Levels 1-5
- Same content, differentiated language support

## Universal Scaffolds (Reused)

- **Visual Supports, Sentence Frames, Vocabulary Support, Cooperative Learning**

**See:** `/universal/frameworks/eb-scaffolding-guide.md`

## Quick Reference

**Levels 1-2:** Heavy scaffolds - visuals, frames, bilingual

**Level 3:** Moderate scaffolds - organizers, vocabulary

**Levels 4-5:** Light scaffolds - academic language refinement

**Remember:** Colorado uses state-specific ELD standards (5 levels) with WIDA ACCESS assessment. Scaffolding strategies are similar to other state ELD frameworks.

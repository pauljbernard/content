**For complete scaffolding examples and implementation:**

**See:** `/districts/washington/language/washington-eld-standards.md` (WA and OR use similar ELPA21 framework)

**Key Strategies:**
- Levels 1-2: Visual supports, sentence frames, bilingual support
- Levels 3-4: Graphic organizers, vocabulary, structured discussion
- Level 5: Academic language refinement, minimal scaffolds

**MLR Integration:** All 8 Mathematical Language Routines support OR ELD levels

**See:** `/subjects/mathematics/common/mlr/` for MLR files

## Implementation Notes

**Content + Language Objectives:**
```
Content: Students will add fractions with unlike denominators.
Language: Students will explain strategy using "first," "then," "common denominator."
```

**Proficiency-Level Differentiation:**
- Same grade-level content for all levels
- Differentiated language scaffolds by level

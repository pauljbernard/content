## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes): Visual Hook

**Activity**: "Transformation Detective"

Display two congruent triangles on screen in different orientations:
- Triangle ABC (blue) positioned upright
- Triangle DEF (red) positioned rotated 90° and translated

**Guiding Questions**:
- "What do you notice about these two triangles?"
- "If I could pick up the blue triangle, how would I move it to match the red triangle exactly?"
- "What stays the same? What changes?"

**Expected Student Responses**:
- They look the same size and shape
- You'd need to rotate and slide the blue one
- The angles and sides stay the same; the position changes

**Teacher Move**: Demonstrate the transformation using GeoGebra animation, showing the blue triangle rotating and translating to perfectly overlay the red triangle.

**Key Concept Introduction**: "When two figures can be matched exactly using transformations like sliding, rotating, or flipping, we call them **congruent**. Today, we'll learn how to prove triangles are congruent using visual reasoning."

### Direct Instruction (15 minutes): Visual Patterns of Congruence

#### Part 1: The SSS Pattern (Side-Side-Side)

**Visual Demonstration**:
1. Display Triangle ABC with sides colored:
   - AB = 5 cm (red)
   - BC = 7 cm (blue)
   - CA = 6 cm (green)

2. Display Triangle DEF with sides colored:
   - DE = 5 cm (red)
   - EF = 7 cm (blue)
   - FD = 6 cm (green)

**Interactive Element**: Use GeoGebra to show that:
- Matching colored sides are equal length
- Attempt to construct a different triangle with these three side lengths (impossible)
- Overlay triangles to show perfect match

**Visual Proof Template**:

```
GIVEN: Three pairs of matching sides (color-coded)
       AB ≅ DE (red segments match)
       BC ≅ EF (blue segments match)
       CA ≅ FD (green segments match)

VISUAL PROOF:
[Diagram showing both triangles with color-coded sides]

Step 1: Match the red sides (AB and DE)
[Animation: Align red sides]

Step 2: The blue and green sides determine unique angles
[Show how fixed side lengths force specific angles]

Step 3: All parts match perfectly
[Complete overlay]

THEREFORE: △ABC ≅ △DEF by SSS (three sides match = triangles match)
```

**Key Visual Principle**: "When three sides are locked in, the triangle's shape is completely determined. No other shape is possible."

#### Part 2: The SAS Pattern (Side-Angle-Side)

**Visual Demonstration**:
1. Display Triangle GHI with:
   - GH = 4 cm (red)
   - Angle H = 60° (marked with arc in yellow)
   - HI = 5 cm (blue)

2. Display Triangle JKL with:
   - JK = 4 cm (red)
   - Angle K = 60° (marked with arc in yellow)
   - KL = 5 cm (blue)

**Interactive Element**: Use GeoGebra to show:
- Match the red side and yellow angle
- The blue side swings out at a fixed angle
- Only one possible triangle can be formed

**Visual Proof Template**:

```
GIVEN: Two sides and the included angle match
       GH ≅ JK (red segments)
       ∠H ≅ ∠K (yellow angles)
       HI ≅ KL (blue segments)

VISUAL PROOF:
[Diagram showing both triangles with color-coded elements]

Step 1: Match the first side (GH and JK)
[Animation: Align red sides]

Step 2: Match the angle (∠H and ∠K)
[Show angle measurement with arc]

Step 3: The second side extends at the matched angle
[Blue side swings to fixed position]

THEREFORE: △GHI ≅ △JKL by SAS (side-angle-side pattern locks the triangle)
```

**Key Visual Principle**: "When two sides are connected at a specific angle, the third side is forced to connect them in exactly one way."

#### Part 3: The ASA Pattern (Angle-Side-Angle)

**Visual Demonstration**:
1. Display Triangle MNO with:
   - Angle M = 50° (yellow arc)
   - MN = 6 cm (red)
   - Angle N = 70° (blue arc)

2. Display Triangle PQR with:
   - Angle P = 50° (yellow arc)
   - PQ = 6 cm (red)
   - Angle Q = 70° (blue arc)

**Interactive Element**: Use GeoGebra to show:
- Match the red side
- Extend rays at the yellow and blue angles
- Rays intersect at exactly one point, completing the triangle

**Visual Proof Template**:

```
GIVEN: Two angles and the included side match
       ∠M ≅ ∠P (yellow angles)
       MN ≅ PQ (red segment)
       ∠N ≅ ∠Q (blue angles)

VISUAL PROOF:
[Diagram showing both triangles with color-coded elements]

Step 1: Match the side (MN and PQ)
[Animation: Align red sides]

Step 2: Draw rays at the matched angles
[Extend rays from M at 50° and from N at 70°]

Step 3: Rays meet at exactly one point
[Show intersection point O/R]

THEREFORE: △MNO ≅ △PQR by ASA (angle-side-angle pattern determines where the third vertex lands)
```

**Key Visual Principle**: "When two angles are set at the ends of a side, the rays can only meet at one point."

### Guided Practice (15 minutes): Visual Proof Construction

**Activity**: "Build and Prove"

Distribute tablet/computer with pre-loaded GeoGebra file containing three pairs of triangles.

**Task 1: SSS Recognition**
- Given: Two triangles with all sides marked (measurements shown)
- Student Task:
  1. Color-code matching sides
  2. Use GeoGebra measure tool to verify side lengths
  3. Attempt to overlay triangles using transformation tools
  4. Complete visual proof template

**Task 2: SAS Recognition**
- Given: Two triangles with two sides and included angle marked
- Student Task:
  1. Identify which angle is "included" (between the two sides)
  2. Color-code matching elements
  3. Use angle measure tool to verify angles
  4. Complete visual proof template

**Task 3: ASA Recognition**
- Given: Two triangles with two angles and included side marked
- Student Task:
  1. Identify which side is "included" (between the two angles)
  2. Color-code matching elements
  3. Use GeoGebra to extend angle rays and verify intersection
  4. Complete visual proof template

**Differentiation**:
- **Support**: Provide partially completed color-coding; include hints for transformation sequence
- **Extension**: Challenge students to create their own congruent triangle pair and prove congruence

**Circulate and Monitor**: Check for:
- Correct identification of congruence pattern
- Accurate color-coding of corresponding parts
- Logical sequence of transformation steps
- Complete justification using visual reasoning

---

### Independent Practice (8 minutes): Visual Proof Challenge

**Activity**: "Prove It Visually"

Provide three new triangle pairs (one for each pattern: SSS, SAS, ASA).

**Student Task**:
1. Determine which congruence pattern applies
2. Create a color-coded diagram
3. Write a visual proof explaining why the triangles are congruent
4. Use transformation language (slide, rotate, flip, overlay)

**Success Criteria**:
- Correctly identifies pattern (SSS, SAS, or ASA)
- Color-codes all relevant parts
- Explains transformation sequence
- States conclusion (triangles are congruent)

**Example Student Work** (SSS proof):

```
Given: △ABC and △XYZ with AB = 5, BC = 6, CA = 4 and XY = 5, YZ = 6, ZX = 4

Visual Proof:
[Color-coded diagram with AB and XY in red, BC and YZ in blue, CA and ZX in green]

Step 1: I matched the red sides (AB and XY) by placing them on top of each other.
Step 2: Since the blue sides (BC and YZ) are also equal, they have to line up perfectly.
Step 3: The green sides (CA and ZX) also match, completing the overlay.

All three sides match, so the triangles must have the same shape and size.

Therefore, △ABC ≅ △XYZ by SSS.
```

### Closure (2 minutes): Visual Summary

**Quick Reflection**:
- "What visual clues tell you triangles are congruent?"
- "How do transformations help us see congruence?"

**Visual Anchor Chart** (project on screen, students copy):

```
Three Ways to See Triangle Congruence:

[Icon: Three colored sides]
SSS: Three sides match → triangles match

[Icon: Side-angle-side sandwich]
SAS: Two sides + included angle → locked in place

[Icon: Angle rays meeting]
ASA: Two angles + included side → rays meet at one point

Key: Look for patterns, color-code, visualize transformations!
```

**Exit Ticket**: "Draw two congruent triangles and label them to show the SAS pattern. Use color-coding."

## Differentiation Strategies

### For English Learners:
- Provide vocabulary cards with visual definitions (congruent, transformation, overlay)
- Use gestures and physical manipulatives (triangle cutouts) alongside digital tools
- Allow verbal explanations instead of written proofs initially
- Pair with bilingual peer for collaborative tasks

### For Students with IEPs:
- Provide pre-made color-coded diagrams (reduce working memory load)
- Use larger screen or projected display for students with visual impairments
- Allow extra time for GeoGebra exploration
- Simplify proof templates (fewer steps, sentence frames)

### For Advanced Learners:
- Challenge: "Can you prove congruence using only two pieces of information in any case?" (explore AAS, HL)
- Extension: "Create a triangle that is NOT congruent but shares two sides with another triangle" (explore importance of included angle)
- Investigate: "Why doesn't AAA (three angles) guarantee congruence?" (explore similar vs. congruent)

---

## Teacher Notes

### Common Misconceptions (Visual Approach):

1. **Misconception**: "If triangles look similar, they're congruent."
   - **Address**: Use GeoGebra to show triangles with same shape but different sizes (similar, not congruent)

2. **Misconception**: "You need to check all six parts (3 sides + 3 angles)."
   - **Address**: Emphasize that three strategic pieces lock in the rest (efficiency of SSS, SAS, ASA)

3. **Misconception**: "SSA (side-side-angle) works like SAS."
   - **Address**: Use GeoGebra to show the "ambiguous case" where two different triangles can have SSA pattern

### Technology Tips:

- **Pre-load GeoGebra files**: Have all diagrams ready to avoid construction delays
- **Use color consistently**: Red, blue, green for sides; yellow, purple for angles (maintain across lessons)
- **Animation speed**: Set to 3-5 seconds for transformations (fast enough to maintain interest, slow enough to observe)
- **Backup plan**: Have printed screenshots in case of technology failure

### Time Management:

- If running short: Reduce independent practice to 2 problems (one SSS, one SAS or ASA)
- If extra time: Add collaborative "Gallery Walk" where students view and critique each other's visual proofs

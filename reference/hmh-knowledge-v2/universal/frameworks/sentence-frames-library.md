# Sentence Frames Library
**Universal Language Support Tool**
**Scope:** Universal (adaptable to all subjects)
**Audience:** Curriculum developers supporting language development

## Overview

**Sentence frames** are partially completed sentences that provide linguistic structure while allowing students to insert content-specific ideas. They support all learners, especially Emergent Bilinguals, in developing academic language.

**Core Principle:** Sentence frames scaffold language production without limiting mathematical or content thinking.

---

## Purpose and Benefits

### Why Use Sentence Frames?

**For Emergent Bilinguals:**
- Provides grammatical structure
- Reduces cognitive load of language production
- Models academic language patterns
- Builds confidence in speaking and writing

**For All Students:**
- Makes thinking visible
- Structures complex responses
- Develops academic vocabulary
- Supports oral and written communication

## Types of Sentence Frames

### Type 1: Discussion Frames
**Purpose:** Support partner and small group discussions

### Type 2: Explanation Frames
**Purpose:** Help students explain thinking and reasoning

### Type 3: Comparison Frames
**Purpose:** Structure comparing and contrasting

### Type 4: Question Frames
**Purpose:** Help students ask questions

### Type 5: Agreement/Disagreement Frames

## Implementation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Differentiate by Proficiency Level

**Emerging:**
- Provide frames for most utterances
- Accept single words + frame
- Allow native language + English

**Expanding:**
- Provide frames for complex structures
- Encourage complete sentences
- Model extending frames

**Bridging:**
- Make frames optional
- Encourage elaboration
- Challenge to create own frames

---

### Strategy 2: Display Prominently

**Anchor Charts:**
- Post in classroom
- Reference during lessons
- Add to as students develop new frames

**Individual Reference:**
- Student notebooks
- Desk cards
- Digital access

---

### Strategy 3: Model Before Expecting

**Teacher Modeling:**
- Use frames yourself first
- Think aloud with frames
- Show how to complete them

**Student Practice:**
- Choral response with frames
- Partner practice
- Whole-class share

---

### Strategy 4: Fade Gradually

**Initial:** Provide full frame
"I solved it by ___."

**Intermediate:** Partial support
"I solved it..."

**Independent:** No frame
Student generates own structure

---

## Creating Effective Sentence Frames

### Do:
✅ Leave open-ended (allow multiple correct responses)
✅ Model academic language structures
✅ Match content and cognitive demand
✅ Provide variety (not always same frame)
✅ Use authentic sentence structures

### Don't:
❌ Make frames too simple (scaffolding, not dumbing down)
❌ Leave only one-word blank (not challenging enough)
❌ Use unnatural language
❌ Require specific answer
❌ Over-scaffold (strips away thinking)

---

## Subject-Specific Considerations

### Mathematics:
- Focus on explaining reasoning

- Support literary terminology
- Author's craft language embedded

### Science:
- Focus on inquiry process

**Remember:** Sentence frames are scaffolds, not crutches. They should support students in producing increasingly sophisticated language, then be gradually released as students internalize academic language structures. The goal is independence, with frames as a bridge to get there.

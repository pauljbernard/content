# Turn and Talk Protocol
**Literacy Routine for Quick Partner Processing and Discussion**
**Scope:** Subject-Common (all ELA programs, all districts)
**Audience:** Curriculum developers creating interactive lessons

---

## Overview

**Turn and Talk** is a quick, informal partner discussion strategy where students briefly turn to a nearby partner to discuss a question, share thinking, or process information. It's faster and less structured than Think-Pair-Share.

**Core Principle:** Brief partner talk increases engagement, provides processing time, and gives all students a voice—not just those called on.

**Literacy Routine Type:** Collaborative (speaking and listening)

---

## Purpose and Benefits

### Why Use Turn and Talk?

**For All Students:**
- Quick processing of information
- Everyone talks (100% participation vs. 1-2 volunteers)
- Brain break during instruction
- Rehearsal before whole-class sharing
- Low-pressure oral practice

**For Emergent Bilinguals:**
- Oral language practice in low-stakes setting
- Peer support for vocabulary and ideas
- Time to formulate English responses
- Native language OK during processing
- Builds confidence before larger group sharing

**For Teachers:**
- Maintains engagement during instruction
- Quick formative assessment (listen while circulating)
- Re-energizes class
- Checks understanding before moving forward

## Turn and Talk vs. Think-Pair-Share

### Key Differences:

| Aspect | Turn and Talk | Think-Pair-Share |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| **Duration** | 30 sec - 1 min | 4-7 minutes total |
| **Structure** | Informal, quick | Formal three steps |
| **Think Time** | Brief or none | Explicit silent think time |
| **Whole-Class Share** | Optional, rare | Always included |
| **Purpose** | Quick processing | Deep discussion |
| **Frequency** | Multiple times per lesson | 1-3 times per lesson |

**Summary:** Turn and Talk is the "quick version" for processing; Think-Pair-Share is the "deep version" for discussion.

## Turn and Talk Structure

### Simple Two-Step Process:

**Step 1: Prompt**
- Teacher poses question or prompt
- Brief (5-10 seconds) for students to think

**Step 2: Talk**
- Students turn to partner
- Both share briefly (30 sec - 1 min total)
- Teacher may or may not call on pairs to share

**Total Time:** 30 seconds to 1 minute (rarely more)

## When to Use Turn and Talk

### Ideal Situations:

**1. Checking Understanding Mid-Lesson**
- "Turn and tell your partner: What is theme?"
- "Turn and talk: What's the difference between these two strategies?"
- Quick comprehension check before moving forward

**2. Activating Prior Knowledge**
- "Turn and talk: What do you remember about [topic from yesterday]?"
- "Tell your partner: What do you already know about [new topic]?"
- Warm-up at start of lesson

**3. Making Predictions**
- "What do you think will happen next? Turn and tell your partner."
- "Based on the title, what might this text be about? Turn and talk."
- Before reading a new section

**4. Processing New Information**
- After direct instruction: "Turn and talk: Summarize the three main points I just explained."
- After video: "What surprised you? Turn and talk."
- Immediate processing

**5. Generating Ideas/Brainstorming**
- "Turn and talk: Where have you seen examples of this?"
- "Share with your partner: What questions do you have?"
- Quick idea generation

**6. Re-Energizing**
- Students getting restless or off-task
- Need to break up teacher talk
- Reset attention

## Implementation Guidelines

### Setting Up Turn and Talk

**First Time Introduction:**

1. **Explain the Purpose**
   - "Turn and Talk is a quick way to share your thinking with a partner"
   - "It helps you process what you're learning"
   - "Everyone gets to talk, not just those I call on"

2. **Demonstrate**
   - Model with a student volunteer
   - Show how to turn, make eye contact, take turns
   - Highlight key behaviors (voices, listening, both talking)

3. **Establish Expectations**
   - **Voice level:** Partner voices (only partner can hear)
   - **Both partners talk:** Not just one person
   - **Eyes on partner:** Active listening
   - **Quick:** 30 seconds - 1 minute, then back to teacher

4. **Create Signal to Stop**
   - Chime, clap pattern, hand signal
   - Practice: "When you hear the chime, stop talking and look at me"

---

### Ongoing Use

**Consistency:**
- Use same language: "Turn and talk"
- Same signal to stop
- Same expectations each time

**Frequency:**
- Multiple times per lesson (3-5 times common)
- Any time students need processing
- Balance with other strategies

**Monitoring:**
- Circulate briefly while students talk
- Listen for understanding
- Note who's engaged/disengaged
- Identify ideas to highlight

---

## Partner Management

### Partnering Options:

**1. Proximity Partners (Easiest)**
- "Turn to the person next to you"
- Fast, no movement needed
- May be same partner all year (if seats don't change)

**2. Designated Partners**
- Pre-assigned "Turn and Talk partner"
- Can be shoulder partner, clock partner, etc.
- See Think-Pair-Share guide for partnering systems

**3. Random Partners (Occasionally)**
- "Find someone wearing blue"
- "Stand up, hand up, pair up"
- Good for community building, but slower

**Best Practice:** Proximity partners for speed; rotate seats periodically for variety

## Scaffolding for Emergent Bilinguals

### Universal Supports:

**Sentence Frames (always display):**
- "I think ___."
- "My idea is ___."
- "I noticed ___."
- "One example is ___."

**Visual Supports:**
- Anchor chart with Turn and Talk icon
- Topic-related images
- Vocabulary word wall visible

**Processing Time:**
- Extend thinking time slightly for EBs
- Allow use of notes or annotations
- Native language processing OK, then share in English

---

### By Proficiency Level:

**Emerging:**
- **Sentence frames:** Simple frames visible ("I think ___." "I see ___.")
- **Native language:** OK to use L1 to process, then try English
- **Partner support:** Pair with expanding/bridging student when possible
- **Visual aids:** Pictures, diagrams to support discussion

**Expanding:**
- **Sentence frames:** More complex ("I think ___ because ___.")
- **Vocabulary support:** Pre-teach key terms before Turn and Talk
- **Encouragement:** "Try your best English"

**Bridging:**
- **Optional frames:** Available but not required
- **Academic language:** Encourage precise vocabulary
- **Extension:** Challenge to elaborate or provide examples

## Common Mistakes and Fixes

### ❌ Mistake 1: No Clear Signal to Stop

**Problem:** Students keep talking after time is up, transitions chaotic

**Fix:**
- Establish clear signal (chime, clap pattern, "3-2-1-eyes on me")
- Practice the signal first day
- Wait for silence before continuing
- Reinforce: "When you hear the signal, stop mid-sentence if you need to"

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Enough Time

**Problem:** Teacher gives 10 seconds, students barely start talking

**Fix:**
- Minimum 30 seconds for Turn and Talk
- Watch/listen - if students still engaged, let it go another 15 seconds
- Adjust based on question complexity

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Too Much Time

**Problem:** Students finish talking but teacher lets it run 2-3 minutes (now it's chaotic)

**Fix:**
- Keep Turn and Talk under 1 minute
- If deeper discussion needed, use Think-Pair-Share instead
- Monitor engagement - when pairs finish, wrap up

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: One Partner Dominates

**Problem:** Same student talks every time, partner just listens

**Fix:**
- Assign roles: "Partner A goes first, then Partner B"
- Use timer: "Partner A has 20 seconds, then Partner B"
- Teach turn-taking explicitly
- Mix up partnerships periodically

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Never Holding Students Accountable

**Problem:** Students know they'll never be called on, so they don't actually discuss

**Fix:**
- Occasionally ask pairs to share: "What did your partner say?"
- Circulate and listen, then highlight good ideas
- Use equity sticks to randomly call on pairs
- Establish expectation: "You might be asked to share"

---

### ❌ Mistake 6: Overusing Turn and Talk

**Problem:** Every single question turns into Turn and Talk (loses impact)

**Fix:**
- Be selective - not every question needs Turn and Talk
- Balance with other strategies (think time, cold call, whole-class discussion)
- Use for key moments, not every moment

---

### ❌ Mistake 7: Volume Too Loud

**Problem:** Room gets too loud, hard to hear signal

**Fix:**
- Teach and practice "partner voices" (only partner can hear)
- Model loud vs. partner voice
- Give feedback: "Too loud, try again with partner voices"
- Praise when volume is appropriate

---

## Grade-Level Adaptations

### K-2: Building Habits

**Focus:** Partner behaviors, short prompts, oral language

**Expectations:**
- Very short Turn and Talk (15-30 seconds)
- Simple prompts
- Teacher models extensively
- Visual cues (turn to partner icon)

**Teaching Tips:**

**Example (K):**
"Turn and tell your partner your favorite part of the story."

---

### 3-5: Developing Complexity

**Focus:** Academic discussion, building on ideas, listening skills

**Expectations:**
- 30-60 seconds
- More complex prompts
- Report partner's idea (not just own)
- Use sentence frames

**Teaching Tips:**
- Teach active listening (eye contact, nodding, asking questions)

- Encourage use of evidence/examples

**Example (Grade 4):**
"Turn and talk: What is the main idea of this section? What details support it?"

---

### 6-8: Academic Discourse

**Focus:** Elaboration, academic language, critical thinking

**Expectations:**
- 45-90 seconds
- Analytical prompts
- Cite text evidence
- Respectful disagreement/building on ideas

**Teaching Tips:**
- Expect academic language and terminology
- Model how to disagree respectfully
- Encourage depth over surface-level responses

**Example (Grade 8):**

**Remember:** Turn and Talk is the workhorse of classroom discussion—quick, flexible, and powerful. Use it liberally throughout lessons to keep students engaged, process information, and practice oral language. The key is brevity (under 1 minute), clear signals, and consistent expectations. When students know Turn and Talk is coming, they stay alert and engaged throughout instruction.

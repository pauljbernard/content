---

## Literary Analysis and Interpretation

### Developing a Thesis/Claim

**Strong Literary Thesis:**
- Arguable (not just fact or plot summary)
- Specific (focused on particular aspect of text)
- Insightful (reveals something meaningful about text)
- Supported by textual evidence

**Example:**
- Weak: "The Great Gatsby is about the American Dream." (too general, obvious)
- Strong: "In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald uses the symbolic geography of East Egg and West Egg to critique the American Dream's corruption by materialism and inherited wealth."

---

### Using Textual Evidence

**Integrate Quotations:**
- Introduce context
- Embed quotation smoothly (use signal phrases)
- Cite correctly (MLA format for literature)
- Analyze and explain significance (don't just drop quotes)

**Example:**
> When Gatsby reaches toward the green light, Fitzgerald reveals his yearning for an unattainable dream: "He stretched out his arms toward the dark water... I could have sworn he was trembling" (25). The trembling suggests Gatsby's desperate, almost physical need for what the light represents—Daisy and the life he believes she embodies.

---

### Literary Lenses/Critical Approaches (Advanced HS, AP)

**Formalist/New Criticism:**
- Focus on text itself (structure, style, literary devices)
- Close reading without external context

**Historical/Biographical:**
- Consider author's life and historical context
- How does time period influence text?

**Marxist:**
- Class struggle, power dynamics, economics
- How does text represent social classes?

**Feminist:**
- Gender roles, representation of women, patriarchy
- How does text reinforce or challenge gender norms?

**Reader-Response:**
- Reader's personal interpretation and experience
- How does text affect different readers?

**Postcolonial:**
- Effects of colonialism, imperialism, cultural identity
- Representation of colonized peoples

---

## Comparative Analysis

**Comparing Texts:**
- **Thematic:** Compare how texts explore similar themes (e.g., coming-of-age, identity, power)
- **Stylistic:** Compare authors' techniques (tone, imagery, narrative structure)
- **Cultural/Historical:** Compare texts across time periods or cultures
- **Genre:** Compare how different genres treat similar subjects

**Organization:**
- Point-by-point (compare one aspect across texts, then next aspect)
- Block method (discuss Text A fully, then Text B, then compare)

---

## Historical and Cultural Context

**Why Context Matters:**
- Texts reflect time period, culture, social issues
- Understanding context deepens interpretation
- Avoid presentism (judging past by present values)

**Contextualization:**
- Historical events (wars, movements, cultural shifts)
- Social norms and values of time period
- Author's biography and influences
- Literary movements (Romanticism, Realism, Modernism, Harlem Renaissance, etc.)

---

## Discussion and Collaboration

**Literature Circles:**
- Small groups read and discuss texts
- Assigned roles (discussion leader, passage master, connector, etc.)
- Student-driven inquiry

**Whole-Class Discussion:**
- Teacher facilitates but students contribute ideas

# Common Cartridge Support Analysis
**Comprehensive Gap Analysis and Implementation Roadmap**

**Date:** November 6, 2025
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Needs Implementation
**Analyst:** System Architecture Review

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** **MINIMAL** - Common Cartridge is acknowledged but not implemented
**SCORM Support:** **COMPREHENSIVE** - 95+ mentions, dedicated agent, full workflows
**Gap Severity:** **CRITICAL** - Common Cartridge is industry-standard for interoperability but lacks any implementation

**Key Findings:**
- ❌ **0% Implementation** - Common Cartridge mentioned once (issue template dropdown)
- ✅ **100% SCORM Implementation** - 322 mentions, full agent, testing, validation
- ⚠️ **QTI Partial Support** - Export skill exists (148 mentions) but not integrated with CC
- 🚨 **Market Gap** - Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard all prefer Common Cartridge over proprietary formats

**Business Impact:**
- **Lost Market Share:** Unable to compete with vendors offering CC support
- **Integration Friction:** Customers must use SCORM (older standard) instead of modern CC
- **Future-Proofing Risk:** IMS Global pushing CC as replacement for SCORM

**Recommendation:** Implement Common Cartridge support across all phases (estimated 4-6 weeks, medium complexity)

---

## What is Common Cartridge?

### Overview

**Common Cartridge (CC)** is an IMS Global Learning Consortium standard for packaging and distributing digital learning content. It's the **modern successor to SCORM** with broader capabilities.

**Current Version:** IMS Common Cartridge 1.3 (2016)
**Adoption:** Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard, D2L Brightspace, Schoology - all support CC import/export

### Key Advantages Over SCORM

| Feature | SCORM | Common Cartridge | Winner |
|---------|-------|------------------|--------|
| **Content Types** | Web content only | Web + LTI tools + QTI assessments + discussion forums + web links | **CC** |
| **Assessments** | Embedded in content | QTI 2.1 (standard format) | **CC** |
| **Structure** | Single course/module | Full course with modules, prerequisites, gradebook setup | **CC** |
| **Metadata** | Limited | Rich metadata (Dublin Core + LOM) | **CC** |
| **Interoperability** | LMS-specific wrappers needed | Platform-agnostic | **CC** |
| **Modern Tools** | No LTI support | Full LTI 1.1/1.3 integration | **CC** |
| **Assessment Portability** | No | Yes (QTI) | **CC** |
| **Gradebook Integration** | Basic scoring | Full gradebook setup (categories, weights) | **CC** |
| **File Size** | Often large | Efficient (external resources via web links) | **CC** |
| **Maintenance** | Declining | Active development | **CC** |

**Use Case Fit:**
- **SCORM:** Legacy content, simple completion tracking, standalone modules
- **Common Cartridge:** Full courses, rich assessments, modern LMS integration, interoperability

## Current Support Analysis

### Phase-by-Phase Assessment

#### 1. Authoring Phase (AUTHOR_GUIDE.md)

**Current State:** ❌ **NO SUPPORT**

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Authors create content in Markdown (format-agnostic - good for CC)
- ✅ QTI assessments can be authored (curriculum.export-qti skill exists)
- ❌ No guidance on "CC-friendly" authoring practices
- ❌ No mention of LTI tool integration (CC supports external tools)
- ❌ No CC metadata requirements documented

**Gap Severity:** Medium (authors unknowingly create content incompatible with CC best practices)

**Missing Sections:**
- "Authoring for Common Cartridge Export" (how CC differs from SCORM)
- "Integrating LTI Tools" (embedding external tools in CC packages)
- "CC Metadata Requirements" (course info, learning objectives, accessibility)

---

#### 2. Editorial Phase (EDITOR_GUIDE.md)

**Current State:** ❌ **NO SUPPORT**

**Analysis:**
- ❌ No CC-specific review checklist
- ❌ No validation that content is CC-compatible
- ❌ No QTI assessment validation in editorial workflow
- ❌ Editors can't verify CC will package correctly before production

**Gap Severity:** Medium (content approved without CC compatibility verification)

**Missing Sections:**
- "Common Cartridge Compatibility Checklist" (8-point checklist like SCORM)
- "QTI Assessment Review" (validate assessment exports correctly)
- "LTI Tool Approval Process" (verify external tools are CC-compatible)

---

#### 3. Production Phase (PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md)

**Current State:** ❌ **CRITICAL GAP**

**Analysis:**
- ✅ SCORM production: 95 mentions, Day 4 of first week training, complete workflows
- ❌ Common Cartridge production: 0 mentions
- ❌ No CC packaging workflow
- ❌ No CC validation tools
- ❌ No CC import testing

**Current SCORM Support (for comparison):**
```
Day 4: SCORM Packaging (6-8 hours)
- SCORM structure understanding
- imsmanifest.xml creation
- SCORM API communication
- Packaging as ZIP
- LMS testing

FAQ Q9-Q11: SCORM troubleshooting
- Package doesn't launch
- Completion tracking fails
- LMS compatibility issues

Troubleshooting Issue 3: SCORM cross-LMS compatibility
```

**Common Cartridge Equivalent:** NONE

**Gap Severity:** **CRITICAL** (production staff cannot create CC packages)

**Missing Sections:**
- "Day 4 Alternative: Common Cartridge Packaging" (6-8 hours training)
- "Format 3B: Common Cartridge Packages" (parallel to SCORM section)
- "FAQ Q21-Q26: Common Cartridge Production"
- "Troubleshooting Issue 9-12: CC Compatibility"

---

#### 4. Engineering Phase (ENGINEER_GUIDE.md)

**Current State:** ❌ **NO SUPPORT**

**Analysis:**
- Engineers don't need to handle CC directly (content-level format)
- However, KB files could include "CC best practices" for specific content types
- No CC-specific knowledge base files

**Gap Severity:** Low (CC is production concern, not KB engineering)

**Impact:** None (no action needed in ENGINEER_GUIDE.md)

---

### Skills and Subagents Analysis

#### Professor Framework - 92 Skills

**Existing Skills with CC Relevance:**

1. **curriculum.package-lms** (SKILL EXISTS)
   - **Current:** SCORM, Canvas, Moodle formats
   - **Missing:** Common Cartridge format
   - **Fix:** Add `--format "common-cartridge"` option
   - **Complexity:** Medium (3-5 days)

**Total Skills Impact:**
- **Existing Skills to Enhance:** 4 skills (9-11 days)
- **New Skills to Create:** 2 skills (8-12 days)
- **Total Effort:** 17-23 days (3.5-4.5 weeks)

---

#### Professor Framework - 22 Agents

**Existing Agents with CC Relevance:**

1. **scorm-validator** (AGENT EXISTS - 528 lines)
   - **Current:** Full SCORM validation, LMS testing, auto-remediation
   - **Status:** ❌ No CC support
   - **Fix:** Extend or create parallel `cc-validator` agent
   - **Complexity:** High (10-15 days for full parity)

**New Agents Needed:**

2. **cc-validator** (NEW AGENT NEEDED)

     * Test import in Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard
     * Generate compatibility reports
     * Screenshot capture and visual regression
     * Auto-remediate common CC issues
   - **Complexity:** High (10-15 days)
   - **Priority:** High (matches SCORM investment)

**Alternative Approach:**

3. **Extend scorm-validator to lms-package-validator**
   - **Purpose:** Universal LMS package validator (SCORM + CC + xAPI)
   - **Benefits:** Single agent, shared testing infrastructure
   - **Drawbacks:** More complex, harder to maintain
   - **Complexity:** Very High (15-20 days)
   - **Priority:** Medium (cleaner architecture but more work)

**Recommendation:** Create separate `cc-validator` agent (cleaner separation, faster to market)

**Total Agent Impact:**
- **New Agents:** 1 agent (cc-validator, 10-15 days)

### Documentation Analysis

#### Guide-by-Guide Coverage

| Guide | Lines | SCORM Coverage | CC Coverage | Gap |
|-------|-------|----------------|-------------|-----|
| **AUTHOR_GUIDE.md** | 3,851 | Medium (workflow mentions) | ❌ None | 50-75 lines needed |
| **EDITOR_GUIDE.md** | 3,500 | Low (package validation mentions) | ❌ None | 40-60 lines needed |
| **PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md** | 2,072 | **HIGH** (95 mentions, full workflows) | ❌ None | **400-500 lines needed** |
| **ENGINEER_GUIDE.md** | 5,285 | Low (not relevant to KB) | ❌ None | 0 lines needed |
| **USER_GUIDE.md** | 335 | Low (overview) | ❌ None | 10-20 lines needed |

**Total Documentation Gap:** 500-655 lines across 4 guides

---

### GitHub Integration Analysis

#### Issue Templates

**File:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/09-lms-packaging.yml`

**Current State:** ⚠️ **PLACEHOLDER**

```yaml
label: Package Type
options:
  - SCORM 1.2
  - SCORM 2004
  - xAPI (Tin Can)
  - Canvas Course Package
  - Moodle Backup
  - QTI (assessments only)
  - Common Cartridge    # ← Listed but not implemented
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ CC listed as option (good UX - shows it's coming)
- ❌ If user selects CC, automation fails (no skills/agents to execute)
- ❌ No CC-specific fields (unlike SCORM which has package_options)

**Fix Needed:**
```yaml
# Add CC-specific options
- type: checkboxes
  id: cc_options
  attributes:
    label: Common Cartridge Options
    options:
      - label: "Include QTI 2.1 assessments"
      - label: "Include LTI 1.3 tool links"
      - label: "Include discussion forums"
      - label: "Generate full gradebook setup"
      - label: "Optimize for Canvas"
      - label: "Optimize for Moodle"
  # Show only if package_type == "Common Cartridge"
```

**Impact:** Medium (template works but misleading)

---

#### GitHub Actions

**File:** `.github/workflows/professor-automation.yml`

**Current State:** ❌ **NO CC SUPPORT**

**Analysis:**
- Workflow invokes Professor skills based on issue type
- `curriculum.package-lms` skill invoked for LMS packaging
- CC format not handled (would fail or fall back to SCORM)

**Fix Needed:**
```yaml
- name: Package for LMS
  run: |
    FORMAT="${{ github.event.issue.package_type }}"

    if [[ "$FORMAT" == "Common Cartridge" ]]; then
      /curriculum.package-common-cartridge \
        --materials "${{ github.event.issue.content_path }}" \
        --output "published/packages/"
    elif [[ "$FORMAT" == "SCORM"* ]]; then
      /curriculum.package-lms --format "scorm2004" ...
    fi
```

**Impact:** High (automation broken for CC requests)

---

### Configuration and Templates

#### Current Template Coverage

**SCORM Templates:**
- `/templates/scorm-1.2/` (exists - inferred from PRODUCTION_GUIDE)
- `/templates/scorm-2004/` (exists - inferred from PRODUCTION_GUIDE)
- `/production/scorm/` (directory structure exists)

**Common Cartridge Templates:**
- `/templates/common-cartridge/` (❌ DOES NOT EXIST)
- `/production/common-cartridge/` (❌ DOES NOT EXIST)

**Templates Needed:**

       <lom:lom>...</lom:lom>
     </metadata>
     <organizations>...</organizations>
     <resources>...</resources>
   </manifest>
   ```

2. **course-settings.xml template** (CC-specific gradebook, completion settings)

3. **LTI tool configuration template** (lti-links.xml)

4. **Discussion forums template** (discussion-topics.xml)

**Complexity:** Low (1-2 days to create templates)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **IMS CC 1.3 spec complexity** | Medium | Medium | Study existing CC implementations (Canvas, Moodle exports), use IMS validator |
| **LMS import incompatibilities** | High | High | Test early and often in all 3 LMS platforms, document quirks |
| **QTI 2.1 integration issues** | Medium | Medium | Leverage existing curriculum.export-qti skill, validate with IMS QTI validator |
| **LTI tool configuration errors** | Medium | Low | Start with LTI 1.1 (simpler), add LTI 1.3 in Phase 2 |
| **Gradebook setup transfer** | High | Medium | Test extensively, document LMS-specific limitations |
| **File path case sensitivity** | Low | Low | Automated validation catches this early |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Low customer demand for CC** | Low | Medium | Survey customers first, validate demand |
| **SCORM still preferred by some LMS** | Medium | Low | Support both (not replacing SCORM) |
| **IMS CC standard changes** | Low | Low | CC 1.3 stable since 2016, minimal change risk |
| **Maintenance burden** | Medium | Medium | cc-validator agent automates testing, reduces manual QA |

**Overall Risk Level:** Medium (technical complexity manageable, business case strong)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)

1. **Validate Demand (Week 1)**
   - Survey 20-30 customers: "Would you use Common Cartridge if available?"
   - Expected: 60-80% say "yes" or "maybe"
   - Decision gate: If <50%, deprioritize; if >50%, proceed

2. **Allocate Resources (Week 1)**
   - Assign 1-2 developers full-time for 6-7 weeks
   - Provision LMS test instances (Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard)
   - Budget: $42,000 total

3. **Begin Phase 1 (Week 2-3)**
   - Create CC templates
   - Create curriculum.package-common-cartridge skill
   - Create curriculum.validate-cc skill
   - Milestone: Can generate basic CC packages

4. **Begin Phase 2 (Week 4)**
   - Update PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md (400-500 lines)
   - Update other guides (100-155 lines)
   - Milestone: Production staff can create CC packages

### Medium-Term Actions (60-90 Days)

5. **Complete Phase 3-4 (Week 5-9)**
   - GitHub automation
   - cc-validator agent
   - LMS testing automation
   - Milestone: Full CC support at SCORM parity

6. **Launch and Market (Week 10)**
   - Announce CC support to customers
   - Update marketing materials
   - Create demo video (CC workflow)
   - Blog post: "Why Common Cartridge Matters"

### Long-Term Actions (6-12 Months)

7. **Advanced CC Features**
   - LTI 1.3 Advantage support (more secure, better UX)
   - IMS Caliper analytics (learning analytics standard)
   - xAPI integration within CC packages (best of both worlds)

8. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Monitor cc-validator agent usage
   - Track customer feedback on CC packages
   - Quarterly compatibility testing (LMS platforms update frequently)

## Conclusion

**Current State:** Common Cartridge is acknowledged (issue template dropdown) but **0% implemented**. This represents a **critical gap** compared to comprehensive SCORM support (322 mentions, full agent, extensive documentation).

**Business Case:** Strong. CC is the modern standard for LMS interoperability, preferred by Canvas, Moodle, and Blackboard. Competitors (Articulate, Adobe, Lectora) all support CC. Without CC, we risk losing market share.

**Technical Feasibility:** Medium complexity. CC is more sophisticated than SCORM but well-documented (IMS specification). Existing QTI export skill is a good foundation. Estimated 33 days (6.6 weeks) to full parity.

**Recommendation:** **Proceed with implementation.** Prioritize Phase 1-2 (foundation + production integration, 3 weeks) for MVP, then Phase 3-4 (automation + testing, 3 weeks) for production-ready solution.

**ROI:** Estimated $42,000 investment yields:
- 95% LMS market coverage (vs. 60% SCORM-only)
- Competitive positioning with industry leaders
- 10-20 new customer requests/month
- Faster packaging (CC simpler than SCORM for some use cases)
- Future-proofing (CC actively maintained, SCORM declining)

**Next Steps:**
1. Validate customer demand (survey)
2. Secure budget ($42,000)
3. Allocate 1-2 developers (6-7 weeks)
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation

# Physical Education Standards Framework
**Level:** K-12

## Overview

Physical education develops physically literate individuals who have the knowledge, skills, and confidence to enjoy a lifetime of healthful physical activity.

**Key Principle:** "Physical education teaches students how to be physically active for life, not just how to play sports."

## K-12 Progression

### Elementary (K-5)
**Focus:** Foundational motor skills, movement concepts, fitness knowledge

**Activities:**
- Locomotor skills (run, skip, hop, gallop)
- Non-locomotor (bend, twist, turn)

- Rhythmic activities, educational gymnastics
- Cooperative games

**Lesson Structure:**
- Instant activity (warm-up)
- Skill instruction and practice
- Application in game/activity
- Cool-down, reflection

---

### Middle School (6-8)
**Focus:** Sport-specific skills, strategies, fitness planning, teamwork

**Activities:**
- Team sports (basketball, soccer, volleyball, etc.)
- Individual/dual sports (badminton, tennis, pickleball)
- Fitness activities (strength training intro, cardio)
- Outdoor pursuits (orienteering, hiking)
- Rhythmic activities (dance)

**Lesson Structure:**
- Warm-up/fitness
- Skill development
- Modified games/scrimmages
- Cool-down, reflection

---

### High School (9-12)
**Focus:** Lifetime activities, fitness independence, personal goals

**Activities:**
- Lifetime sports (golf, tennis, swimming, cycling)
- Fitness (weight training, cardio, yoga)
- Outdoor recreation (hiking, kayaking, rock climbing)
- Dance (cultural, social, fitness)
- Self-defense

**Lesson Structure:**
- Student-led warm-ups
- Activity-specific instruction
- Application, practice, play
- Cool-down, reflection
- Fitness testing, goal-setting

---

## Assessment in PE

### Authentic Assessment

**Performance:**
- Skills tests (rubrics for form and execution)
- Game play (applying skills in context)
- Fitness tests (self-assessment, goal-setting)

**Knowledge:**
- Written or oral (rules, strategies, fitness concepts)
- Exit tickets, quick checks

**Affective:**
- Participation, effort
- Sportsmanship, teamwork
- Self-assessment, reflection

---

### Rubrics

**Example: Overhand Throw (Grade 5)**

| Criteria | 4 (Proficient) | 3 (Developing) | 2 (Beginning) | 1 (Needs Support) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Preparation | Side to target, arm back | Mostly sideways | Facing target | No preparation |
| Step | Steps with opposition | Steps forward | Steps with same foot | No step |
| Follow-Through | Follows through across body | Some follow-through | Minimal | No follow-through |
| Accuracy | Hits target consistently | Hits target often | Sometimes | Rarely |

---

## Differentiation

### By Skill Level
- Vary equipment (larger ball, lower net, modified rules)
- Grouping (heterogeneous for cooperation, homogeneous for skill match)
- Stations (different levels at each station)

### For Students with Disabilities
- Adaptive equipment (audible balls for visually impaired, wheelchair sports)
- Modified rules (buddy system, different scoring)
- Inclusive games (everyone can participate)
- Partner with adapted PE specialist

### By Interest
- Offer choices (sport A or sport B)
- Student-designed games
- Independent fitness plans

---

## Safety in PE

**Always:**
- Inspect equipment before use
- Teach proper technique to prevent injury
- Establish clear boundaries and rules
- Supervise actively
- Have emergency action plan
- First aid kit accessible

**Avoid:**
- Dodgeball (targets students, potential for injury and embarrassment)
- Elimination games (students sitting out for extended time)
- Public weigh-ins or body shaming
- Using exercise as punishment

---

## Inclusive PE

**All students can participate:**
- Modify activities, not expectations
- Focus on personal growth, not comparison
- Celebrate all body types and abilities
- Teach respect and empathy
- Partner with adaptive PE specialists

**Avoid:**
- Picking teams (captain picks last = public humiliation)
- Ability-based teams (high-skilled dominate)
- Public fitness results
- Gendered activities ("boys play football, girls dance")

---

## Fitness Education

### Components of Fitness

**Health-Related:**
1. Cardiorespiratory endurance (heart, lungs)
2. Muscular strength (max force)
3. Muscular endurance (sustained effort)
4. Flexibility (range of motion)
5. Body composition (muscle, fat, bone)

**Skill-Related:**
- Agility, balance, coordination, power, reaction time, speed

---

### FITT Principle

**Frequency:** How often (days per week)
**Intensity:** How hard (heart rate, perceived exertion)
**Time:** How long (minutes)
**Type:** What activity (cardio, strength, flexibility)

---

### Fitness Testing

**Purpose:**
- Self-awareness (baseline, progress)
- Goal-setting
- Fitness knowledge

**NOT for:**
- Grades (fitness levels vary, not all under student control)
- Comparison to peers
- Public shaming

**Protocols:**
- Private testing when possible
- Emphasize personal growth
- Teach students to interpret results
- Students set goals based on data

---

## Knowledge Reuse

- `/subjects/physical-education/high-school/pe-guide.md`
- `/districts/[state]/` (state PE standards)

## Quick Reference

**Every PE Lesson Should:**
- ✅ Align to National Standards (focus on 1-2 per lesson)
- ✅ Provide moderate to vigorous physical activity (50%+ of class time)
- ✅ Teach skills in meaningful contexts (not just drills)
- ✅ Be inclusive (all students participate, all bodies celebrated)
- ✅ Be safe (equipment checked, proper technique taught)
- ✅ Connect to lifelong physical activity
- ✅ Assess learning (not just participation)
- ✅ Develop social-emotional skills (teamwork, perseverance)

**Remember:** PE is education THROUGH movement, not just exercise. Students learn skills, knowledge, and attitudes for lifelong physical activity.

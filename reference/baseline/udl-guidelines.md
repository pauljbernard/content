**Universal Design Learning (UDL) Support Guidelines**

UDL Guidelines Source: <https://udlguidelines.cast.org/>

Universal Design Learning (UDL) is an educational framework that guides
the development of flexible learning to support learners with learning
differences. For Into Math, we are using UDL support to not only enhance
the mathematical content but provide teachers with strategies to
maintain the rigor while increasing accessibility.

There are three Principles of Universal Design Learning: *Engagement*,
*Representation*, and *Action & Expression*. Label the UDL support in
the lesson based on which principle is being addressed, (Example: *UDL:
Engagement*). The Principles are outlined below with examples. Each
lesson will require a **minimum of 2 UDL Supports** to occur after a
Task or with the Task Turn and Talk.

In order to provide comprehensive UDL support, **do not repeat** a
Principle within a lesson.

It is incredibly important that the UDL support correlates to the
mathematical content and skills in the task associated with the support.
Avoid using generalized suggestions but make them specific to the Task
or Turn and Talk being supported. **Do not** copy and paste the content
from the examples below, use them as a guide to write support specific
to the Task.

**[Engagement:]{.underline}** The "Why" of learning.

**Recruiting Interest --** Spark Excitement and Curiosity

-   Individual choice

-   Relevance, value, authenticity of content

-   Minimize threats and distractions to learning

**Sustaining Effort and Persistence --** Tackle challenges with focus
and determination

-   Stress importance of goals and objectives

-   Vary demands and resources to optimize the challenge

-   Foster collaboration and community with students

-   Increase mastery-oriented feedback

**Self-Regulation --** Harness the power of emotions and motivation in
learning

-   Promote expectations and beliefs that encourage motivation

-   Facilitate personal coping skills and strategies

-   Develop self-assessment and reflection opportunities

# MLR1: Stronger and Clearer Each Time
**Mathematical Language Routine #1**
**Source:** Mathematical Language Routines (MLR) Guidelines
**Primary Use:** Tasks (after solving problems)

---

## Overview

**MLR1: Stronger and Clearer Each Time** provides a structured and interactive opportunity for students to **revise and refine** both their ideas and their verbal and written output through iterative sharing and feedback.

**Core Principle:** Mathematical explanations improve through multiple cycles of articulation, feedback, and revision.

---

## Purpose

To have students:
1. **Write** their reasoning about a problem
2. **Share** that reasoning with a partner
3. **Explain** it verbally
4. **Listen** to feedback from partner
5. **Respond** to feedback and ask clarifying questions
6. **Refine** their reasoning by writing again (stronger and clearer)

**Why It Works:**
- Multiple exposures strengthen language
- Peer feedback reveals gaps in explanation
- Revision builds ownership of ideas
- Iterative process mirrors authentic mathematical communication

---

## When to Use MLR1

### Best Situations:
- ✅ After students solve a problem and need to explain thinking
- ✅ When students can ask questions of each other's explanations
- ✅ When refining descriptions or justifications will deepen understanding
- ✅ When building mathematical communication skills is a goal

### Not Ideal For:
- ❌ Before solving (students don't have reasoning yet)
- ❌ Simple computational tasks (not much to explain)
- ❌ When time is very limited (needs 5-10 minutes)

## Where to Embed in Into Math TX

### Tasks (After Solving Problem):

**Placement:** "**THEN,** have students use the **Stronger and Clearer Each Time** routine to discuss their thinking."

**Position in Lesson Flow:**
1. Students work on task (independently or in pairs)
2. Students arrive at solution
3. **MLR1 HERE** - Students explain and refine
4. Whole-class discussion (optional)

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: WRITE (Individual)
**Time:** 2-3 minutes

Students write down:
- Their reasoning for solving the problem
- Their solution strategy
- Any questions they have about it

**Teacher Role:**
- Circulate and observe
- Do NOT provide feedback yet
- Note common approaches for later discussion

**Student Output:** Written explanation (draft form, not polished)

---

### Step 2: SHARE (Pairs)
**Time:** 2-3 minutes per partner

Students share their written thinking with a partner.

**Partner A:**
- Reads their explanation aloud OR
- Explains verbally using written notes

**Partner B:**
- Listens actively
- Does NOT interrupt yet

**Teacher Role:**
- Monitor partnerships
- Ensure both students get turns
- Encourage respectful listening

---

### Step 3: QUESTION (Pairs)
**Time:** 2-3 minutes per partner

Partners ask questions focused on **describing thinking clearly**, especially related to key mathematical concepts or strategies.

**Good Questions:**
- "Can you explain why you did [step]?"
- "How did you know to [strategy]?"
- "What does [term] mean in your explanation?"
- "Can you say more about [unclear part]?"

**Not-As-Helpful Questions:**
- "Is that right?" (focus on clarity, not correctness)
- "Did you get the same answer as me?" (not about explanation quality)

**Teacher Role:**
- Model good questions if needed
- Redirect to "how" and "why" questions
- Encourage specificity

---

### Step 4: REFINE (Individual)
**Time:** 2-3 minutes

Students use insights from discussion to **revise** their written reasoning.

**What to Improve:**
- Add missing steps
- Clarify confusing parts
- Use more precise vocabulary
- Explain "why" not just "what"

**Teacher Role:**
- Circulate and observe improvements
- Celebrate visible revisions
- Note students who made significant improvements for sharing

---

### Step 5: REPEAT (Optional)
**Time:** 5 minutes

For deeper work, students can share with a **second partner** and refine again.

**Why Repeat:**
- Second articulation is usually clearer than first
- New partner may ask different questions
- Further refinement deepens understanding

**When to Skip:**
- Time is limited
- One round produced strong revisions
- Moving to whole-class discussion

---

## Standard Implementation Text

### Full Boilerplate:

```
THEN, have students use the Stronger and Clearer Each Time routine to
discuss their thinking.

Have students write down their reasoning for [insert problem related to
the task] and any questions about it. Then in pairs, have students share
their thinking. Remind students to ask questions of each other that focus
on describing their thinking, especially related to [insert key mathematical
concept(s) or strategy], and to then use insights from the discussion to
refine their answers or reasoning.
```

### Customization Points:

**[insert problem related to the task]:**
- "solving the division problem"
- "finding the area of the composite figure"
- "determining whether the relationship is proportional"

**[insert key mathematical concept(s) or strategy]:**
- "using the distributive property"
- "decomposing the shape"
- "explaining the constant of proportionality"

---

## Examples by Grade Band

### K-2 Example (Composing Shapes):

**Context:** Students composed shapes to make a house.

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Stronger and Clearer Each Time routine to
discuss their thinking.

Have students write down (or draw with labels) their reasoning for how
they composed shapes to make a house and any questions about it. Then
in pairs, have students share their thinking. Remind students to ask
questions of each other that focus on describing their thinking, especially
related to which shapes they used and how they put them together, and
to then use insights from the discussion to refine their answers or
reasoning.
```

**Adaptation for Young Students:**
- Drawing + labels acceptable
- Teacher may scribe for emerging writers
- Verbal explanation emphasized over written

---

### 3-5 Example (Division with Remainders):

**Context:** Students solved word problems involving division with remainders.

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Stronger and Clearer Each Time routine to
discuss their thinking.

Have students write down their reasoning for solving the problem and any
questions about it. Then in pairs, have students share their thinking.
Remind students to ask questions of each other that focus on describing
their thinking, especially related to how they interpreted the remainder
in the context of the problem, and to then use insights from the discussion
to refine their answers or reasoning.
```

**Expected Refinements:**
- First draft: "The answer is 5 R2"
- After feedback: "The answer is 5 R2. The remainder means 2 cookies are left over, so we need 6 boxes total to package all the cookies."

---

### 6-8 Example (Solving Linear Equations):

**Context:** Students solved 2-step linear equations using different strategies.

**Implementation:**
```
THEN, have students use the Stronger and Clearer Each Time routine to
discuss their thinking.

Have students write down their reasoning for solving the equation and any
questions about it. Then in pairs, have students share their thinking.
Remind students to ask questions of each other that focus on describing
their thinking, especially related to which inverse operations they used
and why they chose that order, and to then use insights from the discussion
to refine their answers or reasoning.
```

**Expected Refinements:**
- First draft: "I subtracted 4 then divided by 3"
- After feedback: "I solved 3x + 4 = 19 by first subtracting 4 from both sides to isolate the term with x, giving me 3x = 15. Then I divided both sides by 3 to get x = 5. I chose this order because I needed to undo the operations in reverse order of operations."

---

## Teacher Facilitation Strategies

### Setting Up for Success:

**Before First Use:**
- Model the routine with whole class
- Show what "asking questions to clarify" looks like
- Demonstrate refining written work
- Set norms for respectful feedback

**Partnership Management:**
- Assign partners strategically (or let students choose)
- Consider language proficiency levels
- Rotate partners over time
- Monitor partnerships for productivity

---

### Common Challenges & Solutions:

**Challenge 1: "My partner said I'm right, so I don't need to change anything."**

**Solution:** Redirect focus to clarity, not correctness.
- "Even if your answer is right, can you make your explanation clearer?"
- "Could someone who wasn't here understand your thinking from reading your explanation?"
- "What math vocabulary could you add to make it more precise?"

---

**Challenge 2: Students ask yes/no questions instead of clarifying questions.**

**Solution:** Provide question stems.

**Helpful Stems:**
- "Can you explain why you..."
- "How did you know to..."
- "What made you decide to..."
- "Can you say more about..."
- "What does ___ mean in your explanation?"

---

**Challenge 3: Students don't know what to revise.**

**Solution:** Provide specific prompts.

**Revision Prompts:**
- "Add a sentence explaining WHY you used that strategy."
- "Use the vocabulary word [term] in your explanation."
- "Describe the first step in more detail."
- "Explain what the answer means in the context of the problem."

---

**Challenge 4: Limited time.**

**Solution:** Streamline the routine.
- Skip repeat round
- Share with one partner only
- Focus on one key aspect to refine
- Allow verbal revision instead of written

---

**UDL Action & Expression:** Multiple modes (write, speak, revise)

**Example:**
"UDL: Action & Expression - The Stronger and Clearer Each Time routine allows students to express their thinking in multiple ways: writing independently, explaining verbally to a partner, and revising their written work. This provides multiple opportunities to demonstrate understanding."

---

### MLR1 + Other MLRs:

**MLR1 followed by MLR2 (Collect and Display):**
- After refinement, collect strong phrases from students
- Display on vocabulary wall
- "I heard many of you using the term 'decompose' clearly in your revisions."

**MLR1 followed by MLR7 (Compare and Connect):**
- After refining with partner, compare different strategies
- "Now that you've clarified your own strategy, let's compare it to another approach."

---

## Assessment Opportunities

### Formative Assessment:

**What to Observe:**
- Quality of initial written explanations
- Types of questions students ask partners
- Nature of revisions made
- Use of mathematical vocabulary
- Clarity of refined explanations

**Evidence of Success:**
- ✅ Revised explanations are more detailed than first drafts
- ✅ Students use mathematical vocabulary more precisely
- ✅ Questions focus on clarity, not just correctness
- ✅ Students can articulate what they improved

---

### Collecting Evidence:

**Option 1: Compare Drafts**
- Have students label "Draft 1" and "Draft 2"
- Collect both to see growth
- Celebrate visible improvements

**Option 2: Reflection Prompt**
"What did you change in your explanation after talking with your partner? Why did you make that change?"

**Option 3: Exit Ticket**
"Explain [problem] clearly enough that someone who was absent could understand your strategy."

---

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Explainers:

**Scaffold the Writing:**
- Provide paragraph frames
- Model with think-aloud
- Allow bullet points instead of sentences
- Scribe for students if needed

**Scaffold the Questions:**
- Provide question cards

- Start with simpler prompts ("Can you say more about step 2?")

---

### For Advanced Students:

**Increase Complexity:**
- Require multiple representations in explanation
- Ask for comparison of two strategies
- Push for formal mathematical language
- Challenge to explain so a younger student would understand

**Example Prompt:**
"Explain your solution two ways: using everyday language, then using precise mathematical vocabulary."

---

### For Emergent Bilinguals:

**Language Support:**
- Pre-teach key vocabulary
- Provide bilingual glossaries
- Allow native language in discussion
- Sentence frames in both languages

**Partner Strategically:**
- Pair with bilingual peer when possible
- Pair with patient, clear speaker
- Allow extra time for translation of ideas

## Time Management

### Typical Timing:

**Total Time:** 10-15 minutes

| Step | Time | Activity |
|------|------|----------|
| Write | 2-3 min | Individual reasoning written |
| Share | 2-3 min | Partner A explains |
| Question | 1-2 min | Partner B asks clarifying questions |
| Share | 2-3 min | Partner B explains |
| Question | 1-2 min | Partner A asks clarifying questions |
| Refine | 2-3 min | Both revise individually |
| **Total** | **10-15 min** | **Complete routine** |

---

### Shortened Version (5-7 minutes):

**When time is limited:**
- Write (2 min)
- Share one direction only (2 min)
- Refine (2 min)

**Trade-off:** Less iteration, but still valuable

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Using before students have reasoning
**Problem:** Students haven't solved yet, so nothing to share
**Solution:** Always place AFTER problem-solving

### ❌ Mistake 2: Skipping the writing step
**Problem:** Students just talk, no accountability
**Solution:** Written draft provides something concrete to refine

### ❌ Mistake 3: Focusing on correctness instead of clarity
**Problem:** "Is your answer right?" instead of "Is your explanation clear?"
**Solution:** Redirect to clarity and communication

### ❌ Mistake 4: No time for revision
**Problem:** Feedback happens but no chance to apply it
**Solution:** Always allocate time for individual refinement

### ❌ Mistake 5: Generic prompts
**Problem:** "Explain your thinking" without specificity
**Solution:** Specify key concepts: "especially related to [concept]"

(a) Introduction.

     1. The desire to achieve educational excellence is the driving force behind the Texas essential knowledge and skills for
          mathematics, guided by the college and career readiness standards. By embedding statistics, probability, and finance, while
          focusing on computational thinking, mathematical fluency, and solid understanding, Texas will lead the way in mathematics
          education and prepare all Texas students for the challenges they will face in the 21st century.

     2. The process standards describe ways in which students are expected to engage in the content. The placement of the
          process standards at the beginning of the knowledge and skills listed for each grade and course is intentional. The process
          standards weave the other knowledge and skills together so that students may be successful problem solvers and use
          mathematics efficiently and effectively in daily life. The process standards are integrated at every grade level and course.
          When possible, students will apply mathematics to problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace. Students
          will use a problem-solving model that incorporates analyzing given information, formulating a plan or strategy, determining
          a solution, justifying the solution, and evaluating the problem-solving process and the reasonableness of the solution.
          Students will select appropriate tools such as real objects, manipulatives, algorithms, paper and pencil, and technology and
          techniques such as mental math, estimation, number sense, and generalization and abstraction to solve problems. Students
          will effectively communicate mathematical ideas, reasoning, and their implications using multiple representations such as
          symbols, diagrams, graphs, computer programs, and language. Students will use mathematical relationships to generate
          solutions and make connections and predictions. Students will analyze mathematical relationships to connect and
          communicate mathematical ideas. Students will display, explain, or justify mathematical ideas and arguments using precise
          mathematical language in written or oral communication.

     3. For students to become fluent in mathematics, students must develop a robust sense of number. The National Research
          Council's report, "Adding It Up," defines procedural fluency as "skill in carrying out procedures flexibly, accurately,
          efficiently, and appropriately." As students develop procedural fluency, they must also realize that true problem solving
          may take time, effort, and perseverance. Students in Grade 1 are expected to perform their work without the use of
          calculators.

     4. The primary focal areas in Grade 1 are understanding and applying place value, solving problems involving addition and
          subtraction, and composing and decomposing two-dimensional shapes and three-dimensional solids.

                a. Students use relationships within the numeration system to understand the sequential order of the counting
                     numbers and their relative magnitude.

                b. Students extend their use of addition and subtraction beyond the actions of joining and separating to include
                     comparing and combining. Students use properties of operations and the relationship between addition and
                     subtraction to solve problems. By comparing a variety of solution strategies, students use efficient, accurate, and
                     generalizable methods to perform operations.

                c. Students use basic shapes and spatial reasoning to model objects in their environment and construct more
                     complex shapes. Students are able to identify, name, and describe basic two-dimensional shapes and three-
                     dimensional solids.

     5. Statements that contain the word "including" reference content that must be mastered, while those containing the phrase
          "such as" are intended as possible illustrative examples.
